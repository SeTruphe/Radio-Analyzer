How are you?
It's all a cunt. You get pushed from all sides.
Ahh.
You don't even know who's where anymore.
So, what, have you guys made it far or what?
No fucking way! If we try to go back, there's our [people], damn, and a shooting.
А,а.
We're fucked. This is really fucked up. I'm fucked up already. My nerves, damn, are fucked up, fuck. I wanna go home quick. I can't.
I want to go home fast. I can't.
Probably.
There's shit here anyway. Kids, damn it. Nobody hates us here, shit. Our soldiers fucking rape these women. Idiots.
Are our [soldiers] raping these women?
Yes.

Yes.
Assholes!
I can't fucking take it here anymore. I'm gonna fucking try to go home now, fucking, fuck it all, on holiday. Get the fuck off me. 
Now go on, good luck to you.
But, fucking, they just won't let [me] go, fucking. Yeah, they just won't fucking let [me] go. They said, fuck.
Yeah, they just won't let [me] go, fucking. They said, fuck, it's either shoot, fuck, or fight.
Fucking motherfuckers! Fucking democracy! Why don't they supply weapons? 
They can't, you see.  We have khokhlys everywhere. They can't get there, they can't get through
Ahhh. 
They are everywhere, damn it.
Every day there's a lot of casualties, yeah?
Damn many. With us, damn, all of them. Our whole battalion fell, damn it. We lost a colonel, damn it, the commander...
