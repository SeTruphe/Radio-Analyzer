Don't we have any fucking artillery, for fuck's sake? No artillery, armoured vehicles?
No heavy artillery, no engineering, none at all. We don't even have APCs in the company. 
Oh, please, motorised rifle company, motorised, damn it! With bicycles or scooters, fucking?
Who can what, yeah?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And what, and nothing? No promises?
No promises? No predictions that there will be any kind of technology? Shit, nothing, yeah?
No, there's still a tank there with us. But he, you know, he can't shoot. Like this. And there's one somewhere around here in another place. It can't drive. That's how it is.
O!
There are two tanks here.
There's another one.
Where's the third one?
There is none!
