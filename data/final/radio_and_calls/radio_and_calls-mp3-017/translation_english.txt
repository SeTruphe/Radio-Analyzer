We've been sitting in this village for a month now, fuck. We can't really push our fucking offensive. The Ukrainians are fucking up our unit all the time, fucking up. They won't let us fucking advance. Their strongholds are well equipped. That's all. A tank rolled out, fired at our [soldier] and rolled away. As they're still coming, the machine guns open fire, fuck, our [soldiers] get gunned down. Everything. Our [soldiers] leave again without one. They got everything. When our [troops] advanced, they rolled out the technology there, shot our [soldiers]. They shot down our infantry, our infantry. And that was it.
...They shot down our infantry, our infantry. And that's it. Fuck! Our [people] are all panicking, everybody, fuck it. Nobody wants to go on the offensive. They broke the technology, they broke the grenade launchers. It's all fucked up. We're left with
nothing, bullshit. Everything, everything, everything is fucked! What an offensive! And so the whole fucking week.
Obviously.
Yes.
There's no perspective there, is there?
No fucking way. Just no fucking way. No fucking way. That's how we fight.
