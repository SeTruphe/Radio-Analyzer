Well what, in short, the boys have called this hopeless committee of yours. We are, he says, in this.... We are not in Ukraine. Can you imagine that? We're in training.
Well, damn. We know. We've already written to all the authorities. Nobody gives a shit. 
You guys didn't wait for the bodies either. And it's unlikely they'll be sent anytime soon.
What won't be sent?
The dead...
What won't be sent?
The dead, the dead. And there are many of them: from Lebedyan and Lipetsk.
Madness! Igorjok called and said there was nothing to eat there with you.
Nothing, I agree. No food at all. If you don't have money, you eat the sprouted wheat from the field, damn it. And with us they brought inmates from prison.
And now what?
They were taken somewhere...
They were led somewhere all the way to the front. And we're sitting like a barricade unit. If anyone runs back, we'll kill them. 
It's a nightmare.
And that's exactly how it's set up for us. That is, we sit second and guard the first. Behind us there is another row. You can't go back there either. So there is no possibility to run away. Our own people will shoot us.
