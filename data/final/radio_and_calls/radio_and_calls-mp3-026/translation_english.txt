How did the night go?
Every day it gets worse, worse, worse. There are less, less, less people. They give BK less, less, damn it. Used to shoot with 10, with 20, now it's three or four missiles. Fart, fart, fart. Mines fart, fart. Khochlys ta-ta-ta-ta, damn. 
...ta-ta-ta-ta, damn. And we answered: Knock, knock. Own people shot at our people, fucked us, you could say. They shot [own people] with "Grads" at 30 yards.
What-what did you do?
Our people shot our own people this morning.
And what, are they stupid or what?
Well, some fool corrected 30 and 500 South. It should have been 500 north. The missiles actually landed on us. Where's north and where's south, they don't even know.
...they don't even know. Artillery spotter.
Ouch!
Today we stormed the old positions again. Khochlys shot down all our people again. We wanted to take it back. They shot everyone there in the course of the fight.
The two hundred, hell, the three hundred. The attack choked, fucking choked. The deputy commander of the battalion, damn it, a big faggot, damn it, ordered it, damn it, to take back the positions. He decided that if they didn't leave, our people would shoot at them from behind.
Well, what kind of...
...if they wouldn't leave.
Well, what fools, eh?
Yeah, well, I say there's meat here. We're only needed as meat.
And how do they pick up the wounded?
They crawl out by themselves. If he crawled out, he crawled out, and if he didn't, he died.
Well, idiots, damn it. Is there no one left to shoot? Or is there nothing left to shoot with?
–ê? 
Is there nothing left to shoot with? Or is there no one left to shoot with?
Cowards, damn them. They shoot from a distance. If they fired with a direct line of fire, they would hit. But they don't shoot. They fire somewhere there far away, and they fire from the stage.
...somewhere there far away, and they shoot from the stage. That's all. And what artillery spotters we have! It's either a hit on the field or on our people. I say, there the Khochlys are laughing at us. They're pissing themselves with boiling water laughing right now, damn it. They're not even hiding, damn it.
