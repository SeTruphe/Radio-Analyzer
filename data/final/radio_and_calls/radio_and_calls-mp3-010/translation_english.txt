"81." (Eighty-first), I am "85." (Eighty-fifth). Where is the air support? Where's the air support?
"85." (Eighty-fifth), I'm "81st." (Eighty-first). The air went, went your way. Over.
How long has he been gone? This "Bajraktar "* has been behind us for a long time, following us, shooting, fuck.
"Eighty-five." I'm "81." You have established movement towards me. Over.
"81.", I'm "85."                                             
"81.", I'm "85." We zigzag towards you, manoeuvring against the blows.
Receiving you, receiving you. Is the "82nd." ("Eighty-second") with you? End.
"82." ... "82nd" and "83rd", both have been hit. 
"Eighty-fifth", I'm "81st". I have received you, received you.
I am "85th."
"Eighty-five.", I'm "81st".
Yes, "81st." If possible, take the "82nd" and the "83rd" in tow.
"85th", I am "81st". Question mark. Do "82nd" and "83rd" have movement? Do they have movement or not? Fuck!
Neither of them are moving. I repeat, "82nd" and "83rd" have no movement.
I got it, I got it. Follow alone! I am "81st". Over.
Roger that. We're zigzagging towards you. "81." I'm "85." "Bajraktar" is still following. I repeat. He's still following us. 
I copy, copy, "81st." Over.
Where are you watching our air? Tell me where you...
... Air? Tell me, where do you observe our air?
"Eighty-five." I'm "81." Over and out.
In reception it's "85."
"85th", I'm "81st". If possible, take "82nd" and "83rd" in tow. I am "81st." Over and out.
You told me to come to you. I went around 25 big ones! Twenty-five big ones!
25 big ones! For months at most [xxxxx]. I'm "85." There's still this "chandelier" above me. How do I do it? You have to take it under him. I have tried! A total of three missiles had already been fired at me when they were standing! I'm "85."
"81.", "81."! A fourth rocket was fired at us. Where is the air? Where's the air? 
Where's the air? Where's the air? Fourth missile on us! "81." I'm "85." Fourth missile fired at us. Where's the air? Where's the air?
"Eighty-five," I'm "81." I've received the information. I'm here all the time, in contact with the superiors. I keep them informed of everything you tell me.
