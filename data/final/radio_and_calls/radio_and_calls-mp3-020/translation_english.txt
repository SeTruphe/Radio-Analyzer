Already the crowds, the throngs of mobilised people are coming back home. Not the kind that should come home.
What do you mean? 
Well, in the zinc.
Ahh.
With us at the MUKR... With us in the MUKR of Siberia, there is already a huge amount of them. They write it almost every day. It is written almost every day. 
Yes? 
And they write what is the most interesting. But we can't see ourselves so far...
But we can't really get our heads around this situation until now. And it's not like there's.... somewhere in an exercise or somewhere in a war effort. He fell asleep, damn it, and never woke up. There was an incident recently. And he was there on the front line. He fell asleep and didn't wake up.
Well, I don't know, maybe to... not to spoil the statistics, so to speak, damn it. I'm going to say it's fucked now, everybody there is going to fucking die. Fucking who goes...
are gonna fucking die. Damn, who else is going there? They're still collecting there for December.
Well, I know that, yeah.
Yeah. Say they just die and that's it. Well, you see, it's like that with me, damn it.... Now we were in Novosibirsk. Some of us stayed there in tents. 
And?
There one, in short, cut his wrists, damn it. The second, in short, was stabbed. The third died of booze. The fourth...
The fourth was fucked in the ass by three men, for fuck's sake.
Well, I know that. That's what Mitja told me.
Well, it's fucking shitty there, in short, it's totally shitty. So that's, fuck, at least four people, fuck, who didn't even make it to the war.
