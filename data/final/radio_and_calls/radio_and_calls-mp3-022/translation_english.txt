Our people burned the khokhlys with phosphorus again, fuck. The fireworks, in short, were at night. There totally fucked up! A rocket flies and bursts into several pieces in the air, just like a Bengal fire, you know.
I understood.
–ê?
I got it.
If that fucking thing gets on your skin or body, it burns, in short, to the bone, fucking. 
...to the bone, fucking. And such a strong glow of fire! It was a cunt.
A nightmare!
Well, they don't have that fucking thing. Only our people have that.
