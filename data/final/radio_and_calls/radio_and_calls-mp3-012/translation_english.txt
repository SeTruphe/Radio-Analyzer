Your bunny! Here it is!
I want to go home so much! I want to go home so bad! I'm so fucking sick of it! Fuck!
Hold on!
War, fuck! I'm so fucking sick of it all! I want my birth mother! I love you!
You'll be back soon. Everything will be fine.
I'll go back home. I know that I will return home. I am sure I will return home alive and well. First of all, what I... 
First, what I will do. I will drive. I will drive to the cemetery to your grandmother because she is my guardian angel. Then I'll go to the church, to the Topovsky monastery. I will travel to all the churches. I know that Lord, God will protect me.
You will come, you will tell everything.
For the whole life, for the whole life. I'm sick for life, fuck. Do you know how many bodies I've seen here that you've never seen in your life?
...that you've never seen in your life? Just no head, no legs, no torso, no nothing, fuck. Generally just the ones that come in zinc coffins, fuck, are collected there, are just thrown away. Just body parts, fuck. In some piece of ground, everything is thrown away, fuck. And that's it, fuck. It's just, just a total disaster. And I'll never get over it. There's meat here. Here's cunt. Today is our six three hundredth*. Yesterday...
...six three hundredths. Yesterday, four "300" (three hundredths). Well, in short, I'm, I'm done. You know, I honestly can't imagine this world where you have to pay money. Where cars drive, where people drive. What's it like here with us? Cars don't drive. Here we have broken roads and broken security cameras. Here, there are broken DPS [road traffic posts].
Here, near the DPS posts, the tanks were blown up.
...the tanks were blown up. Here, everything was blown up. There's just no, there's no, here, here, there's no people here.
There is just a horror there!
Here is just chaos. You just... you just don't imagine what... what... You just don't imagine what's going on here. I'm telling you, I need to be treated right now. Here's cunt. I can't even imagine what that's like. I have no idea how to even get back to a normal life.
