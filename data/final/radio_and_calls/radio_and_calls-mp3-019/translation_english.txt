I have no time left to live here, fucking. There's fucking shit there, all of it. We're standing. There's a meat grinder here.
That's enough! What are you talking about?
Nothing. In short, there was an offensive, fucking. There are khokhlys in front of us, khokhlys to the side and khokhlys to the right. And there's no fucking way they're going to pull us out. They said to stand to the last, fuck. We're shipping the mobilised by the fucking parcel. By the package, imagine that?! Not one person a week, but 17 people a day.
That's fucked up.
Enough, enough, what are you saying? 
Nothing. Do you think I fucking find it funny or what? It's not that simple, shit. [XX] She sleeps there. [XX]
Not funny. I just...
Our own people fired, and that's it, goddamn it. They put the correction in wrong. Our own people fucked it all up on our end, goddamn it. There's nothing fucking there. All [people] are wet and dirty here, damn. There are no clothes, and the brains are fucked. The water's been used for the third day...
...and the brains are getting fucked. The water hasn't been delivered for the third day. There is no water at all. Mobilised–µr officer, damn it. He, damn it, has worked all his life, damn it, as a site supervisor. He blinks at you, looks at you. Elevator, just yesterday... Well, yesterday he said that Elevator.... Elevator has to be fucking taken. How can you take it when there's three machine guns, fuck? And he: 'It was an order to take it'. Fucking, fucking, they killed seventeen mobilised men immediately. We just got up from the field, fucking.
We just got up from the field, fucking. While we were dragging them back, we were being shot at with grenade launchers. We turned around and he was fucking gone. He's already fucked half a kilometre ahead of us, fucking.
