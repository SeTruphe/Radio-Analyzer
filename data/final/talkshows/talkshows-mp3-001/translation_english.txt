I can't help but ask you. "Special military operation," news coming from Solidar. - The first in the new year, the most exciting political broadcast. Issues that are important for everyone. - "...And in the fate of Russia". Interview of the President on the course of the special military operation and the state of the economy. Again, they are already preparing another package of sanctions against us. What does Putin mean by these words, "I will put it so nicely." Right now and only with us. Good evening.
Good evening. In the first working week of the new year, the President held a meeting with members of the government. They talked about the main areas of the country's development, including social support for residents of Russia's new regions.
Vladimir Putin also thanked the ministers for their efficient work last year, thanks to which none of the gloomy predictions of our opponents came true.
However, in addition to the successes, the President also highlighted some shortcomings in no uncertain terms. 
The times are ever...[now.]
...shortcomings. Times are tense now, you have to act quickly. And yes, part of this meeting was actively discussed afterwards. It is about the dialogue between Putin and Deputy Prime Minister Manturov. But it's important to understand that we witnessed a moment, although quite emotional, that worked. Now we can all get a better picture of how closed presidential meetings work.

On the line is Novo-Ogaryovo. Everyone take your seats. Deputy Prime Minister Manturov has taken his seat in advance. And since the report to Putin was pending, he repeated the key statements. [This is] The president's first meeting with the government in the new year.
"Dear colleagues, good afternoon." Manturov's first report on...
The first report from Manturov on the production of new aircraft under the sanctions. The plans are extensive, for many hundreds of units. However, it has turned out that the factories do not yet have firm contracts. Putin urged haste: "Long. Too long. The companies need to understand their prospects, their orders. They need to hire workers. They need to maintain or expand production capacity. Do you understand? There is no order even for the 23rd year." 
"In general.
"In general, for all our enterprises for this year - and the Ministry of Defense has confirmed the figure - all capacities are set up both for the current year and for next year."
"Denis Valentinovich, as long as there are no passports, which you said yourself, but there are none, and as long as there are no firm contracts, they have no idea what to do. Long, too long. Please, I beg you, speed up this work. Well, none, there are no contracts in the companies."
"Well, none, there are no contracts in the companies for the 23rd year. Do you understand, what is there to say?"
"Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have contracts both for the Ministry of Defense and for the civil sector, for aircraft, as I reported. We have everything prepared."
"Denis Valentinovich,"
"Everything prepared."
"Denis Walentinovich, Denis Walentinovich, you have prepared everything, but no contracts.
I tell you, let me [tell you] now, after we finish the meeting, why do we start a quarrel with you? What do you answer me? I know there are no contracts in the companies."
"I know there are no contracts in the companies. That's what the directors told me. Why are you making such nonsense anyway? When will there be contracts? That is what I am talking about. The directors tell me that there are no contracts. And you have everything prepared, well. When will..." 
"I can..."
"When will there be passports? When will there be contracts? Those are the questions that need to be answered."
"As far as the passport for the 63 aircraft that I just reported on, that was signed today..."
"I proposed the signed order today. Strictly according to your instructions. As for the other passports, this will be done during the quarter." 
"So that within a month, I beg you, within a month everything must be done. And actually, quarter of any. What are we talking about? We don't understand under what conditions we live.  I'm asking you to get this work done within a month. Okay? (=Good?=Is that clear?)
"We will try to do the best we can."
"We will try to do the best we can with our colleagues in the economic block. Thank you."
"No, don't try to do the best possible, but please do it within a month. It has to be done within a month, not later. All right?"  
"All right." 
"Do you understand why I'm talking about this? You said we would do it in the very near future. What's in the very near future? Well, it should be clear and obvious. But I'm not just saying that, am I? The directors of the companies say no....
"The directors of the companies say there are no contracts. Well, okay. Let's talk some more."
According to our information, the conversation between the President and the Deputy Prime Minister took place soon. And Putin's press secretary Peskov has also stated that the public dialogue that took place was perfectly fine - it was a normal process. All the more so because Putin is generally very satisfied with the Cabinet of Ministers after last year's results. A wave of sanctions fell over the country, but the economy withstood everything.
"None of what our adversary predicted for us..."
what our adversary predicted for us has come to pass."
According to the year's results, inflation was below forecasts, and many sectors of the economy ended the year with strong gains, such as construction.
"It was one of the best in our history. In terms of residential construction, it's probably the best year ever."
There is a need to maintain a good pace in the economy overall and eventually achieve growth in the most important indicator for people.
"Real wages and incomes of people, as well as measures of social support, especially for families with children, ensure[s]...
"[...Social support measures,] especially for families with children, ensured a further reduction in poverty and inequality." 
The new regions of the country also need to be brought quickly up to the nationwide standards. 
"The most acute issues in life need to be resolved now. I understand that the situation in the new subjects [=areas] is difficult, that fighting is still going on in some areas, that peaceful life has not yet been restored everywhere, and that people's security is not yet guaranteed. Of course, all these factors must be taken into account. But all this is not a reason to pause."
"[But none of this is a reason to]... pause and put off solving the most pressing problems until later."
The same minimum wage has been set in the new areas as in other regions, and the same benefits are being introduced. Over 14 thousand families have already received maternity benefits. Of course, this is very important. No one has cut the money. And people's standard of living must rise. 
On Friday, Vladimir Putin came to Ufa to say goodbye to the first president of Bashkortostan, Murtaza...
...with the President of Bashkortostan Murtazua Rakhimov, who led the republic for 20 (=twenty) years. And as the President noted, he played a very important stabilizing role at a crucial stage of Russian history, when the Soviet Union collapsed. But even today, the residents of Bashkortostan are behaving courageously and responsibly, defending the sovereignty of Russia and our people in the Donbass, Kherson Oblast and Zaporozhye. 
The President himself gave such an assessment to the people of Bashkiria during our interview with him.
...During our interview with him, which was recorded before his departure from Ufa. However, the questions during the interview were not only related to Bashkiria. We are now showing the whole thing for the first time. Take a look at the whole story. 
BACKGROUND MUSIC
That's why I allow myself to say...
"Therefore, I take the liberty of saying XXXXX [in Bashkir]." 
In Bashkir, Putin wishes success in the development of the republic.
"In Bashkiria, our entire Russia is reflected like a drop of water.
With its diversity of culture, religions, languages, with friendship among peoples. We will all follow your example and appreciate what Russia has achieved over hundreds-hundreds of years."
"Therefore, I take the liberty of saying [XXXXX] [in Bashkir]." 
In Bashkir, Putin wishes success in the development of the republic.
"In Bashkiria, our entire Russia is reflected like a drop of water.
With its diversity of culture, religions, languages, with friendship among peoples. We will all follow your example and appreciate what Russia has achieved over hundreds and hundreds of years."
"...Russia [has] achieved over hundreds and hundreds of years. Russia is an absolutely unique place on Earth. Simply unique. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that a huge number of nations, nationalities, peoples, languages and cultures are concentrated here. But the uniqueness of Russia was that for centuries, almost a thousand years, there was this fusion of peoples and different ethnicities..."
"...and different ethnic groups lived harmoniously. There is nothing like it in the world.  Bashkortostan, where we are, is the best example of that. 112, yes? Peoples and nationalities. 112." 
At that time, Murtaza Rakhimov headed the republic and had his own vision of the region's development.  In the 1990s, he prevented the liquidation of collective farms and state farms and relied on domestic resources. 
Today we process milk, buy meat, buy what we have....
We buy meat. What do we have, a Russian mentality worse than European or American? Today we have to work. 
"The republic has lived under his leadership for almost 20 years, recovered from the well-known tragic events of the collapse of the Soviet Union and achieved a great deal. In a very difficult and decisive period of Russian history, he played a significant, visible and positive role."
Mintimer Shaimiev, the former head of Tatarstan, and current head of state Rustam Minnikhanov also came to Ufa to bid farewell. The two republics have always had and continue to have a special relationship.
I know what internal competition between Bashkortostan and Tatarstan.
And to compete and to consult. We have lived amicably and always found understanding. The two republics are huge.
The impetus for the development of the republic and the city of Ufa itself was also given by the former head of state...
...was also given by the former head of state, the president of Bashkortostan, Murtaza Rakhimov.
But the most important thing in the 1990s and early 2000s was not even the economy, but maintaining interethnic peace in the republic at such a difficult time for all of Russia.
At that time we were like a boiling cauldron. The country seemed to have disintegrated. That was the dream of the West. 193 large and small nations united the great Russian people. In reality, the God unites.
...unites the God. That is why our anthem says. We sing, we sing, we sing all at once. Our country protected by God, Fatherland.
Central Spiritual Administration of Muslims of Russia is located in Ufa.
I am very glad that everything is developing so actively.  As you said, in 2000 there were 16 mosques and now there are a thousand.
...Thousand.
1,200 in Bashkortostan alone.
This speaks for the development of our traditional religions, including traditional Islam.
One region that is important for the country has received special attention all these years. One of Putin's first working trips was precisely to Bashkortostan.

I love you! My name is Rinald. Give me your autograph.

Look at the visor.
Symmetrical.
Are you ready to support at the state level our brand...
...to support our brand "Bashkir honey" and promote it not only within the country, but also at the international level?
What are you and I doing now? I now say publicly in front of the camera that it is a great product, I recommend it to everyone. I tried it myself, I am very satisfied. 
He didn't just try honey.

In 2015, Ufa will host the largest international summits of BRICS* and SCO**. A spacious...
...BRICS and SCO. A spacious and cozy yurt where the politicians held their talks. And such important events are always a strong impetus for the development of the whole region. The most important meetings took place one after another in the capital of Bashkiria. 
And when is that? 
And that is right after. The press goes, we confirm the agenda and make a speech. 
The work schedule continues, so there is half an hour for questions. I suggest that we do not waste time. 
Half an hour to answer questions? You have lost your mind. 
The Republic did it in the 1990s....
The Republic managed in the 1990s and 2000s not only to maintain important enterprises, but also to modernize them and start a number of new factories. 
Can't we revive this tradition? To reward that...
Let me just give you a kiss. Congratulations, everyone. 
The Republic's dedicated entrepreneurs are finding their own interesting solutions, even in the face of today's harsh Western sanctions.
"Aibat Hallyar", a Bashkir fast food cafe. 
Sorry, what's the name of it? 
"Aibat Hallyar."
Sorry, what's the name of it? 
"Aibat Hallyar."
I heard, "The Ipad is free". I think, "Well, how! What a good project! We'd all love to be a part of it."
Yes, yes, "Aibat Hallyar" translates to "It's going well." So it's an answer to the question, "How's it going?"
I am one hundred percent sure that replacing foreign owners and producers will lead to better services for our citizens. One hundred percent sure. That's very interesting...
...very interesting and delicious. So I will be happy to order something. I will be happy to order something. Don't you ship it? No? I will ask.
So far we ship it only within Ufa, but we can send it to you in Moscow. 
Oh, and the kystybyj is ready! This is [XXX] love. 
We also have people who are building. Young people are building. We have a very high pace of construction, the numbers speak for themselves. People in Bashkortostan are very proud of their republic, not only of its natural beauty. We can be proud of our appearance now....
...We can now be proud of our appearance of our villages and cities. But we want to have more reasons for our pride, and that is why the head of the republic has a whole list of appeals to the president for the development of the region. Putin has already supported many projects. Since these photos appeared, tourism in Bashkiria has also boomed. Since then, thousands of visitors from different regions flock here every winter. 
Don't take pictures, get on your skis!
Don't take pictures, get on your skis!
Beloretsk and Abzakov ski resorts now have good infrastructure. There is never a problem with snow here either. What's more, it snowed so much in early January that you could even judge the extent of the snowfall from the window of the presidential plane. It is now minus 15 degrees in Ufa and there is certainly wind blowing at the airfield, but Putin did not refuse a short interview.
I ask for [pardon]...
...a short interview.
I beg your pardon! It's just that Bashkiria is my native republic. I was born here. And that's why I wanted to...
Where were you born?
In the town of Beloretsk. Nearby is the Abzakovo ski resort. You skied there in the early 2000s.
I skied with pleasure. I would like to do it again. It is a beautiful place.
By the way, there are a lot of tourists there now, right after your visit.
Great.
I would like to ask you the following. At a meeting with the Head of State of the Republic, you said that this is a special region. Could you perhaps explain in more detail what...
...Could you perhaps explain in more detail what you meant by that? 
Well, this is... There is no need to invent anything here. Let's start with the fact that since their voluntary entry into the Russian Empire, the Bashkirs have also voluntarily taken upon themselves a special mission, the mission of protecting the external borders of the common Fatherland, the border guards. During the Patriotic War of 1812, Bashkiria deployed almost the entire...
...Bashkiria put almost the entire male population over 15 years of age on horses, armed them and sent them to fight the enemy. No less courageous and heroic behaved the inhabitants of the republic during the Great Patriotic War. Therefore, it is not surprising to me that even today the republic is behaving as responsibly in carrying out tasks within the framework of a special military operation to protect our people in the Donbass, Kherson region and Zaporozhye.... 
...behaves just as responsibly. On the one hand, it is warm and cordial to the people participating in the war operations and their families, and at the same time it is statesmanlike. And, among other things, Ufa, the capital of the republic where we are now - this also happened historically - has always been one of the most important and significant centers of Russian Islam. It is an enlightened, creative...
...creative and highly respected in the Islamic world Islam, which is at the same time patriotically oriented and focused on interaction with all other traditional denominations in our country. In this sense, we can say that Bashkiria has always played a particularly significant role in the life, history and destiny of Russia.
I can't help but ask you just now about the particular military operation you mentioned. News from Solidar is arriving.
...you mentioned. News from Solidar is arriving. Overall, how do you assess the dynamics of the special military operation? 
The dynamics are positive. Everything is developing according to the plan of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff. And I hope that our fighters will please us more than once with their combat performance. 
And the last question. You are again preparing a new package of sanctions against us, but the situation in the economy, at least visually, everything seems to be that we are holding everything, so to speak. Is that really the case?
The situation in the economy...
...is holding everything, so to speak. Is that really the case?
The situation in the economy is stable. More than that, it is even much better than what not only our opponents, but even we predicted. I would like to reiterate that all macroeconomic indicators show this. As I said in a recent meeting with the government, one of the most important indicators is unemployment, which is at a historic low. Inflation is lower than expected. It has, which is particularly important, a trend toward ...
...importantly, a trend to decline. I think it could go down from the current 11.9% to 5% after the results of the first quarter of this year. And that is a very important indicator for ensuring a decent standard of living for people and securing their real incomes. Industrial production, agriculture and construction are also on the rise.
...Agriculture and construction [are on the rise]. Therefore, overall, our situation is not only stable, but I think quite satisfactory. I'll say that cautiously, though not well. 
Thank you very much.
All the best.
Thank you very much.
The President flew away, but the residents of Beloretsk and Abzakov are now wondering, of course, when they can expect him for the promised new skiing in the Bashkir mountains. 
Was it cold? 
Very. The airfield, minus 15. Nevertheless, the conversation took place.
...the conversation took place.
Pavel, almost eight years ago, the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France signed the Minsk Agreements, or Minsk-2, at the Minsk Summit. And all these years, this document was considered the only way to achieve peace in the Donbass. But Ukraine has never abided by any of its provisions. Recently, the former presidents of Germany and France bluntly admitted that their main goal was not to end the bloodshed....
was not to end the bloodshed and the civil war, but to give Kiev time to reinforce the army. What the political cynicism and duplicity of the West has led to, we can see now. 
Almost eight years ago, my cameramen and I were also working that night in Minsk. And now, after hearing the confession of Merkel and Oland, I understand, of course, that every picture taken at those talks, every word spoken there, is perceived quite differently. We remember and we watch the video.
We remember and we watch the video.
MUSIC
Yes, you can often hear that politics is a dirty business. Maybe. But not so much. Not to that extent.
...But not so much. Not to this extent. And where are justice and truth here? There is nothing but lies and hypocrisy. The entire so-called Western bloc, formed by the United States in its own image, is the empire of lies par excellence. 
When this speech of Putin was sounded in February, many paid attention to the words "empire of lies".
Yet it was hard to imagine that the key players in Western politics would themselves soon begin...
...of Western politics would themselves soon begin to admit publicly that they were lying.
Now the former French president who signed the Minsk agreements has backed Merkel's recent statement on the Minsk agreements, saying, "Yes, Angela Merkel was right. Since 2014, Ukraine has strengthened its military capabilities. Its army has become very different. It is better trained and better equipped. And the merit of the Minsk agreements is that they have given the Ukrainian army this opportunity .
...Have given the Ukrainian army this opportunity.
Every picture that was taken that night, every word that was said here is now perceived very differently.
Four o'clock in the morning, negotiations continue.
Sixteen hours of negotiations, during which even the soldiers of the honor guard were staggering with fatigue. And here the leaders report the results.
The resolution of the conflict covers a wide range of issues, all of which have been considered [in this paper]. 
...All of which were considered in this paper. 
At the time, Poroshenko made a gesture as if he were being strangled. After all, at that time his troops were defeated by the Donbass militias and took revenge on ordinary people every day. 
Why are your troops bombing civilians, Mr. Poroshenko? Mr. Poroshenko, why are your troops bombing civilians?
The way out of the crisis lies in strict compliance with the Minsk agreements, and we must take steps [to resolve the conflict].
...And we need to take steps to resolve the conflict. The 2014 Minsk Agreements were an attempt to give Ukraine time, and it has used that time to become stronger. The Ukraine of 2014-2015 is not modern Ukraine. As we saw in the Debaltsevo region, Putin could have easily won then. And I doubt very much that NATO countries could do as much as they are doing now to support Ukraine. It was clear to all of us that it was a frozen conflict, but just that.... 
...that it was a frozen conflict, but that's what gave Ukraine valuable time.
It just shows that we did everything right in terms of launching a special military operation. Why? Because it turned out that no one would abide by the Minsk agreements. The Ukrainian leadership also said that. But I still hoped that the other participants in this process would be sincere with us. It turned out that they, too, deceived us. The point was just to pump Ukraine full of weapons and prepare it for battle. But we see, yes. Apparently...
