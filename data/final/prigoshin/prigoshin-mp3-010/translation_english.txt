I don't know if that makes you happy or it amuses you, so. The normal recidivism rate in our country.... You can tell by your faces that you are not here for the first time, as they say, so. The recidivism rate within a month was always 4.5%. Now it's down to 0.38%.
Everybody who comes out thinks I'm going to live a normal life, so, you know. Out of 700 people...
Out of the first 700 people, one came back, went into the jewellery shop and robbed it straight away.
2 million he almost had in his pocket, along with compensation for his injuries.
*He was arrested immediately."
And the second one bet an ex-military man on who could fight better, PMC or the Defence Ministry. Well, in the end, the ex-military man had no eyes, so **he rented the box**. You've heard it before, right?  With Covid, by the way.
...We approached Ivanovskoye. Borya Sommel has received an award as "Hero of Russia". Troika [group of three] in charge of accommodation.  Let's talk about the problems. 
I don't know why [you say] like that? I am not against United Russia, but the fact is there.
But I am against it.
Yes?
Sit the fuck down.
And so in general, thank you very much for everything!
...thanks for everything!
No fucking way! [No shit!] Complain, go on, damn it.
What are you gonna do to me? Five stars, just like in the movies. I can't come to my senses!
Thank you. For New Year's Eve and for old Silverster [the old New Year], and you can't eat it all. The whole gun was returned, you know. Thank you very much. Yes, you get new clothes.
When you come after being wounded, you give everything. I can't say anything bad about that.
If it's winter clothes, it's winter clothes.
I would really give my life for that kind of attitude. Just from the heart...
Just from the heart, without any words.
Just a human thank you.
We are grateful.
Thank you very much.
Well, come on!
