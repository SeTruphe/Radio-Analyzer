I am addressing the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Aleksandrovich Zelensky. Dear Vladimir Aleksandrovich, the PMC units of "Wagner" have practically surrounded Bakhmut. There is only one road left. The pincers are shrinking. If the Ukrainian professional army fought with us before...
...the Ukrainian professional army, then today we see more and more old men and children. They are fighting, but their life near Bachmut is short. One or two days. Give them a chance to leave the city. The city is practically surrounded.
Vladimir Alexandrovich, I appeal to you as president of our country. Please give me the chance to return home.  [xxxxxxxxxxxx]
