A request has been received from the Daily Storm. I take this opportunity to respond, in principle, to pay respect to all journalists. The first questions are about what PMC "Wagner" fighters shout when they go into battle. Apparently they have seen too many films or cartoons. Shnurov's song says, "Fuck you all. I hear Bach!", and the fighters of PMC "Wagner" say, "Fuck you all..."
...from PMC "Wagner" say, "Fuck you all. I hear Wagner!". That's the first answer to the first question. The answer to the second question. Yaitsky, who is said not to have fought in PMC "Wagner". A little later we will meet with a man who fought with him and knows his story well. He will say a few words to you. What I know from the reports of the commanders, he was badly wounded, he fought excellently. He was...
He was in hospital after being wounded. After his pardon, he went home on 31 December. But you don't have to be superman to fight, you have to have balls as well as a good education. And Yaitsky obviously had them. Now for the sofa critics in a nutshell. Strelkovs, Sobolevs, Slutskis over there. When you sit on your sofas, the world sees....
When you sit on your sofas, the world looks very different. All your stories about how you were once in the army, how you once wore the epaulettes of a general, that's all from the distant past. Live in the present. War is different from anything that happened in the last century or in this century, with the exception of the Patriotic War. I am not saying that, but the experienced fighters who are going to this war with a gun in their hands. 
...go to this war with a weapon in their hands.
