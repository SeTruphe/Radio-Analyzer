2 April, 11 p.m. sharp. Behind me is the city administration building. This is the Russian flag. This flag is inscribed with a good memory of Vladlen Tatarsky. Legally, we have conquered Bachmut. And the commanders of the units that captured the administration [city administration] and the entire central quarter will carry and hang these flags.
...These flags. The flag of PMC "Wagner". These are the guys who took Bachmut. Legally, it belongs to us. The enemy stayed in the western quarters. April 2nd, 23:00. Come on, boys.
