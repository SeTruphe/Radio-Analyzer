We are at one of the cemeteries of the PMC "Wagner". This is a cemetery near Ekaterinburg. Those who were either born in Ekaterinburg or went to the front from here are buried here. We are used to monuments....
We have got used to monuments of the Great Patriotic War and mass graves of soldiers. Now we have to understand that our country has got new heroes and a new branch of our history. And so this monument to those who fell in the new war, in the new war....
...war of a new turn in our great history. Remember them! The mass graves, I think, will also appear. Each of these men died a hero and died bravely. One who dies is always a hero in war. One goes under the bullet face to face. And the other does not flee under enemy.... 
And the other does not flee under enemy artillery and does not leave his trench.
Therefore: Thank you and eternal remembrance!
