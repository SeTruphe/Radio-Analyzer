The main problem today, especially with the PMCs, is to somehow dilute the PMC "Wagner" so that it is no longer a big force that can play some role in domestic politics, so firstly, and secondly, everyone is told that at some point there will be a struggle for power, everyone must have their own private army. Those who have money, (they) think it's a great issue....
...they think it's a great issue right now to put together PMCs. And so they [PMSc] start multiplying. PMC of "Gazprom" - "Potok" (Stream), which we call "Blue Stream".
All kinds of PMCs "Bokarev", PMC "Reduts" (Redouts) and so on. One pair of each creature.
