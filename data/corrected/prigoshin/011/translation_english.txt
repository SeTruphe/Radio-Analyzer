- ...Were they American enemies trying to send you to the hereafter, or were they own internal scumbags jealous of your success?
-- That, too, as they say, will probably be clarified by the relevant authorities. We will hope so. It is already normal. All the more reason to say that a comrade-in-arms has come here. As they say, a man who is a patriot of Russia and does everything in his power. He brought me a fighting sledgehammer, such as...
######## START OF 000004.MP3 (0:01:24 - 0:01:54s) ########
-- ...a fighting sledgehammer, such as PMC "Wagner". Now I have a service sledgehammer. And there is also, as they say, an award from your boss himself.

-- In principle, yes, you have to think where it is specifically from us. 
- Well, of course, [xxxxxxxxxx] on the promenade.
-- There you see how it is. Literally a few days later, I think that I will already be there.
 In just a few days, I think I'll be there already. In principle, they have already finished the cleaning itself at my place. Well, something, bromcyan, or so, bromcyan...
