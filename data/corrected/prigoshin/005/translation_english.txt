 April 2, 23.00 exactly. Behind me is the building of the city administration. This is a Russian flag. On this flag is written a good remembrance to Vladlen Tatarsky. Legally, we conquered Bakhmut. 
And the commanders of the units, that conquered the administration and the whole central quarter, will carry and put up these flags.
