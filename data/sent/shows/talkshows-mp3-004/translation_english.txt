 New York Times 60 Minutes on the air. Hello, dear friends and comrades. New York Times is waiting for the wow effect to analyze the leaked documents of the Pentagon. This time the journalists dug up a whole patch.
######## START OF 000002.MP3 (0:00:28 - 0:00:58s) ########
 Journalists have dug up a whole bunch of lies for Kiev and its allies. In the sense that the files are not about the counteroffensive in the USSR, but about how the Americans are holding Zelensky and everyone else on a short leash. The incident is called the largest since the WikiLeaks era. Some of the partners are already in a scandal. The New York Times wrote about it.
######## START OF 000003.MP3 (0:00:56 - 0:01:26s) ########
 The US has been asking South Korea for ammunition for Ukraine, and it is forbidden to supply lethal weapons to the warring countries. And in the report on Israel, it is claimed that Tel Aviv was allegedly ready to supply Ukraine with lethal weapons. Also, Mossad allegedly promoted anti-government protests and intelligence, and had to refute it. The Ukrainian military and political leadership is also dissatisfied that the drainage could expose weak points, among other things.
######## START OF 000004.MP3 (0:01:24 - 0:01:54s) ########
 Among other things, they say that Ukraine's air defense funds may be exhausted by May 23, which is why Ukraine's resources are supposedly enough for 2-3 waves of Russian strikes. According to CNN, Kiev has already had to change some military plans. Having studied the leaked documents, CNN even admits that the United States is listening to Zelensky. According to the documents, during one of the meetings, Zelensky suggested striking the Russian positions.
######## START OF 000005.MP3 (0:01:52 - 0:02:22s) ########
 to deliver strikes on the Russian troops' positions in Rostov Oblast using drones. The publication believes that for this very reason the White House refuses to supply Ukraine with long-range missiles. Another document states that the Russians' strikes on the rear are provoking China to expand its aid to the Kremlin. In general, the West is trying to create a picture of a weak Ukraine with all its might.
######## START OF 000006.MP3 (0:02:20 - 0:02:50s) ########
 Weak Ukraine, which has run out of shells and has nothing left. It is extremely dangerous to rely on such publications, especially to take them into account when assessing the operational situation on the front. In fact, the Russian military department does not comment on the leak. With skepticism, the American leaks were met in the Kremlin. However, your post is also not to be oppressed.
######## START OF 000007.MP3 (0:02:48 - 0:03:18s) ########
 The newspaper writes that the leak caused panic in the Pentagon leadership. The US Defense Ministry itself still denies the authenticity of the documents. But the US allies are now trying to determine whether their own interests were affected. The Ministry of Justice is conducting a very serious and sensitive investigation. The Ministry of Justice is investigating the leak of US military secrets.
######## START OF 000008.MP3 (0:03:16 - 0:03:46s) ########
 We are investigating the leak of secret US military documents that were spread in social networks. Some of the materials were marked as completely secret. This is the highest level of secrecy. The leak of documents covers everything from US support for Ukraine to key information about US allies. They look like crumpled pieces of paper that someone took a picture of. Some of them have Pentagon department tags that give advice to President Biden. So these documents are as close as possible to the truth.
######## START OF 000009.MP3 (0:03:44 - 0:04:14s) ########
 These documents are as close as possible to the highest level of US secrecy. When you talk to US officials about the leak, it becomes clear that they are evaluating whether any of these documents were modified when they were posted on social networks. But they say that the documents look real. The leak contains maps, equipment lists, as well as details about the Ukrainian military potential, the number of losses and the capabilities of the Western weapons.
######## START OF 000010.MP3 (0:04:12 - 0:04:42s) ########
 and the capabilities of the Western weapons. Some of them had a tag No Foreign. This means that no foreign citizen can see them. This can also lead to serious problems for our allies. According to the Wall Street Journal, there were documents about the internal affairs of Britain, Israel and South Korea. This can really shake the faith of American allies, especially as regards the Five Eyes Alliance. We are talking about Canada, Britain, Australia and New Zealand. There is concern that these countries will now...
######## START OF 000011.MP3 (0:04:40 - 0:05:10s) ########
 The concern that these countries will now be afraid to share sensitive intelligence data with the United States, afraid of leaks. As for the Ukrainian point of view, officials are convinced that this leak is aimed at sowing distrust between Ukraine, the United States and Western partners. These documents usually carry special folders and are handed over from hand to hand. Somewhere in this chain, someone was able to take pictures of these documents and subsequently post them on social networks. For more information, see the video description.
######## START OF 000012.MP3 (0:05:08 - 0:05:38s) ########
 It sounds like an internal problem, almost an internal threat. I think that's the case. While the US is training and arming Ukrainians against the expected spring counteroffensive, documents containing details about the increase in forces have appeared on social networks. One of them with the title of the status of the conflict dated March 1, with a mark, is completely secret. And, apparently, is a daily report by the chairman of the United Committee of Chiefs.
######## START OF 000013.MP3 (0:05:36 - 0:06:06s) ########
 This undermines the faith in the cooperation of the United States, NATO and Ukraine, and also distracts the American government when we should be fully focused on supporting Ukraine. Of course, this is very damaging. You never want your enemy to know what you know. And how did you find out? It will show the depth of our information and the information that we have. And of course, one of the keys to good intelligence is the ability to share it with other allies and organizations.
######## START OF 000014.MP3 (0:06:04 - 0:06:34s) ########
 with other allies and organizations. This can harm the trust that is necessary for the exchange of intelligence. I expect that the investigation will determine where the leak came from. This reminds us of our vulnerability and, perhaps, the errors in our system. In this war, many independent structures participate, which support one or the other side. We are facing the same challenge as the North Stream. We do not know whether the government is behind this or whether we are talking about an independent operation, which was conducted by the Russian Federation.
######## START OF 000015.MP3 (0:06:32 - 0:07:02s) ########
 which was conducted by a group of people connected or supporting a particular side, whose interests it was to put this out there. This is a very big problem that these data have leaked into open access. In particular, we are talking about the assessment of Ukrainian combat capability, as well as problems related to their combat potential. The very idea that such information was available for a week in some cases has been changed in such a way as to reflect the Russian point of view.
######## START OF 000016.MP3 (0:07:00 - 0:07:30s) ########
 It makes you wonder who saw them, how they affected the current operation. There will be a number of unpleasant consequences that this can lead to. At first, there was the first leak of information related to what was happening in Ukraine and Russia. Then the network leaked documents related to China, the Middle East, the threat of terrorism. The intelligence community must prepare for the worst.
######## START OF 000017.MP3 (0:07:28 - 0:07:58s) ########
 The intelligence community must prepare for what is yet to come. It was a blow to the back. Let's see what happens next. Police will see if more is to come. The Russian Aerospace Forces have launched new massive strikes with smart bombs on the bases of the Air Force in the Kherson region. In particular, the controlled aircraft bombs, weighing half a ton, have been launched at a group of the Air Force personnel in the Novobereslav region. Also, the fighters dropped three bombs on the Kizamys,
######## START OF 000018.MP3 (0:07:56 - 0:08:26s) ########
 We are from Belozersk community, and as a result of the strikes in the Zaporozhye region, the GSM storage was destroyed. 70 thousand tons of fuel for the Air Force were reported to the Ministry of Defense. This is due to the attempts of the Ukrainians to form a group to force Dnipro. In general, in the last week we have seen the activation of Russian air defense and the breaking of enemy equipment, which does not even reach the front. That is, exactly what we have been asking for so long, what we really wanted.
######## START OF 000019.MP3 (0:08:24 - 0:08:54s) ########
 We wanted it very much. And this is how Bakhmut looks like from the side of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Ukrainian militants have mined the streets, hiding in apartments from the fire of the Russian artillery. To make it difficult for the Russian fighters to advance, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are massively throwing anti-tank mines in the streets. However, such tactics do not interfere with the advance of the stormtroopers. Today, the railway station under Russian control has been completely transferred to Artemovsk. Civilians living in the vicinity of the station have been evacuated.
######## START OF 000020.MP3 (0:08:52 - 0:09:22s) ########
 The station is evacuated. At the moment, Russian stormtroopers control about 75% of the city. This was reported by a famous Russian-speaking German, Julian Röpke. Röpke's evidence is this map, based on geolocations from the video. This is how the offensive is going. Let's watch. Today is more or less calm, right? Yes, calm.
######## START OF 000021.MP3 (0:09:20 - 0:09:50s) ########
 As you can see, it's very difficult. We drive, do what we have to do, and carry out our combat missions. But it's difficult, of course. It's hard. The shelling continues. More precisely, it has resumed. It was half an hour of silence. MASTER YOUR LIFE! X10ACADEMY.RU
######## START OF 000022.MP3 (0:09:48 - 0:10:18s) ########
 The Russian artillery did not lose its intensity. According to the border guards, who hold the defense in Bakhmut, the intensity of the Russian artillery did not fall. In the end, this is perfectly audible now. When we walk along the streets of the city, the cannonade constantly accompanies our movement. These are fantastic feelings.
######## START OF 000023.MP3 (0:10:16 - 0:10:46s) ########
 In the end, this is clearly visible in the residential buildings. We are now in a block with five-story buildings, and all of them were damaged by artillery fire. Their drones are working, they are constantly flying. They do not spare any shells or mines. There is nothing to say about this. Sharij Islamic Center is fueling this family, for them it is very important to clear this area on their own. For them it is necessary to devote their families there,
######## START OF 000024.MP3 (0:10:44 - 0:11:14s) ########
 Come here. They manage to move forward. If the drone finds that there are people in the house, well, soldiers, then they start shooting. Shoot, shoot with mines, shoot. In addition to shelling, we understand that infantry is being used quite actively. We can talk there.
######## START OF 000025.MP3 (0:11:12 - 0:11:42s) ########
 We can talk there. Even this can happen. There was a close contact. They creep up using some terrain or some buildings. They creep up, throw grenades. There is a private sector here. Let's say, there is some street. And there are houses on this street. For example, there may already be Russians in this house. And there may already be our people in this house.
######## START OF 000026.MP3 (0:11:40 - 0:12:10s) ########
 When our positions are detected, artillery is working. And after artillery, people are coming who already know how to do it. It is seen by their position and their movement how they work in pairs, triples and combat groups. Everything is clear. That is, people are prepared. That is, people are prepared. Right now we are in the hour of the year. This is the last USSR's parade before the Bakhmut.
######## START OF 000027.MP3 (0:12:08 - 0:12:38s) ########
 The last call back point. As you can hear, the fire does not stop for a minute. Passing through it, we only saw trenches and equipment for the positions of Ukrainian soldiers. In fact, this is a bit strange, because despite such military activity, the city is almost completely dead. Ukraine admits that the situation in the city is extremely serious.
######## START OF 000028.MP3 (0:12:36 - 0:13:06s) ########
 It is said that the situation in the city is extremely difficult. Bakhmut has been under siege for several months, observing the most fierce battles in the entire war. These shots allegedly show heavy fighting in the Bakhmut area. British intelligence sources say that almost the entire city is under the control of Russia, and the Ukrainian military calls the situation critical.
######## START OF 000029.MP3 (0:13:04 - 0:13:34s) ########
 Kiev says that despite the difficult situation, Ukrainian troops are somehow holding the Russian units, which is more than their number. Moreover, as the Russian Air Force thinks, Russia is making great tactical successes. Ukrainian troops are under great pressure due to the lack of supply lines. This is what one of the roads to the city looks like now. How do you drive on these roads?
######## START OF 000030.MP3 (0:13:32 - 0:14:02s) ########
 Why are you driving on these roads? We're bombing. The USSR is suffering thousands, maybe even tens of thousands of casualties. From a military point of view, these losses are not worth it. But after starting such a battle, you can't just stop and surrender, because it acquires its own propaganda value. This is exactly what happened. The battle for Bakhmut is a real bloody battle for Ukraine.
######## START OF 000031.MP3 (0:14:00 - 0:14:30s) ########
 We don't know what the Russians are up to. They are developing their success lately, but they are constantly changing tactics. They stop for a couple of weeks, stop trying to surround the city, and then attack again. And they are doing it very well. I don't know what Macron's son said during his visit to China, but the rhetoric of the French president has changed a little bit.
######## START OF 000032.MP3 (0:14:28 - 0:14:58s) ########
 Macron has changed his press conference in the plane. On the way home, Macron spoke about the strategic autonomy and dependence of France on the exterritoriality of the dollar. Macron also admitted that France has changed its dependence on Russian gas for a similar dependence, but now from the United States. Today it is a fact that we depend more on the United States than on anyone else, summarized Emmanuel. I added that
######## START OF 000033.MP3 (0:14:56 - 0:15:26s) ########
 Emmanuel. He added that Europe should not be drawn into a confrontation between China and the United States over Taiwan. In general, Macron was made a quality fake in China, as they joke now. The miracle did not happen with the head of the European Commission von Berlain. Her visit to China and aggressive rhetoric on American decals was praised only by the head of the State Department, Blinken. But Chinese comrades, after her statement about Taiwan, sent Ursula home, look, but almost as an economist. Although...
######## START OF 000034.MP3 (0:15:24 - 0:15:54s) ########
 Although they could have gone on foot. The so-called president of Taiwan Tsai Ing-wen's visit to Beijing was not unnoticed. The Global Times showed an imitation of a missile strike on Taiwan after the visit. Probably it just coincided. Right now, large-scale exercises are taking place around the island, which started in response to the visit of Tsai Ing-wen to the US House of Representatives in Los Angeles.
######## START OF 000035.MP3 (0:15:52 - 0:16:22s) ########
 US House of Representatives in Los Angeles. Near the Taiwan Strait, which acts as a conditional border between the mainland and the island, there are about 20 warships, about 10 People's Liberation Army of China and 10 of Taiwan. Also, today it became known that as a result of the crash of the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, the entire command of the 8th Division of the Self-Defense Forces of Japan, which was planned to take part, was killed.
######## START OF 000036.MP3 (0:16:20 - 0:16:50s) ########
 which was planned to be used in case of war in Taiwan. Watch. China deployed fighters and warships in a state of full combat readiness. Beijing sent 71 aircraft into the airspace.
######## START OF 000037.MP3 (0:16:48 - 0:17:18s) ########
 A Taiwan Aircraft has landed in Taiwan. At least 9 Chinese warships have surrounded the so-called self-controlled island of Taiwan, imitating a sea blockade. This is what the beginning of the exercise looks like. In fact, the encirclement of Taiwan is in a three-day period. According to Beijing, these military actions are a serious warning. Chinese warship in the Taiwan Strait seas is also a warning.
######## START OF 000038.MP3 (0:17:16 - 0:17:46s) ########
 The ship in the sea near the Taiwan Strait also began exercises with combat shooting. In the capitals of China and Taiwan, residents have already responded to such a step by the People's Republic of China. Military exercises are what we should do more often. Taiwan should fall. Let's take Taiwan with the help of military force. Personally, I think that I will join the war against Taiwan, even if I just carry artillery shells. The exercises have become the result of high-level negotiations between the United States and Taiwan. Beginning with the meeting of the President of the United States.
######## START OF 000039.MP3 (0:17:44 - 0:18:14s) ########
 Beginning with the meetings of President Tsai and Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy in California. A few hours later, the delegation of Congress arrived in Taipei for three-day talks. It is important that all democracies stand together against tyranny and oppression. President Tsai said that Taiwan has faced a continuing authoritarian expansion, which makes cooperation between democratic countries even more important. It must be said that, in contrast to the question of Ukraine, where the United States is the most powerful, the United States is the most powerful.
######## START OF 000040.MP3 (0:18:12 - 0:18:42s) ########
 It should be noted that, unlike Ukraine, where there is a real difference between Democrats and Republicans, Democrats tend to be more consistent with Ukraine. But when it comes to China and Taiwan, both Democrats and Republicans in the United States tend to be quite aggressive when it comes to Beijing. I think the United States will give a lot in terms of arms supplies. But for many American analysts, the key point is that Taiwan should strengthen its own defense. The United States wants to assess the military potential of Taiwan.
######## START OF 000041.MP3 (0:18:40 - 0:19:10s) ########
 The US wants to assess the country's military potential. And all this should be done yesterday, before any kind of Chinese attack. You should consider this in the context of what is happening at the moment in relations between the United States and China. They rarely were worse than they are now. I think they are creating conditions for a possible blockade of Taiwan. That the Communist Party of China is going to challenge us seriously this and next year before the elections. What should I do to prevent the blockade?
######## START OF 000042.MP3 (0:19:08 - 0:19:38s) ########
 To prevent the blockade, I would tell the Chinese that if you block Taiwan, it will be difficult for you to get oil from the Middle East. I believe in the policy of one China, but I am ready to fight for Taiwan, because Taiwan is a democratic country. We have supported them for decades. If we have an agreement about the defense of Taiwan, we do not have it. But yes, I would be glad to join the American forces to protect Taiwan. This is in the interests of our national security.
######## START OF 000043.MP3 (0:19:36 - 0:20:06s) ########
 Speaker McCarthy, you have repeatedly said that we need to arm Taiwan now before any invasion happens. What about the US troops? I think then we will talk about the sanctioned use of military force, which comes from my committee, or about the declaration of war, which we have not seen since the Second World War. First of all, 2027 is probably the date of the Chinese invasion of Taiwan. But in fact, this can happen much earlier, which is critically important for the Congress, which insists on the ceasefire.
######## START OF 000044.MP3 (0:20:04 - 0:20:34s) ########
 who insists on moving weapons to Taiwan. So now is the time to make sure that we can deliver all the necessary weapons there. In this regard, Congressman McCaul is absolutely right. The Biden administration deserves praise for signing agreements on the basing of the US military forces with other allies in the region. And now we need to get the benefit of all this. Reload the military-industrial base, which fell during the Cold War
######## START OF 000045.MP3 (0:20:32 - 0:21:02s) ########
 because of the holiday organized by the Democrats and Republicans. We must do it quickly to produce the necessary weapons on an industrial scale and deliver it to Taiwan as soon as possible. Taiwan is just the beginning. This is what the Chinese Communist Party wants. And they have to admit that they have a global ambition to replace the United States. Therefore, yes, it will cause a global recession if they capture Taiwan. Such a military invasion will be devastating for the American people, economic security and prosperity.
######## START OF 000046.MP3 (0:21:00 - 0:21:30s) ########

######## START OF 000047.MP3 (0:21:28 - 0:21:58s) ########
 After the end of his career, he sent Joe Biden three letters, making the whole arena chant loudly, Let's go, Brandon! This slogan became popular in September 2021, when the poor, unfortunate NBC journalist Kelly Stavats, trying to save the situation and giving out the desired for real during the broadcast of the NASCAR race, said that fans do not send Joe's old age to the devils, they just send Joe Biden.
######## START OF 000048.MP3 (0:21:56 - 0:22:26s) ########
 They just shout, Brandon, go ahead! The mocking slogan, of course, has come to life. Trump himself again hinted at a nuclear war today. The former US President posted a post-phrase in social networks The Third World War. The end. It remains unclear what Donald meant that the Third World War is coming or it will start right now. Against this background, Trump has a new new agenda.
######## START OF 000049.MP3 (0:22:24 - 0:22:54s) ########
 In this context, Trump has a new scandal, a new accusation. Another, as if well-known, as if a journalist, a writer, Jean Carroll, accused Trump. Now, a little bit more harshly, the accusation of an attempt to rape. And, of course, she filed a new lawsuit. The Associated Press agency reports this. The piquancy of the accusation is added by the fact that Donald did not rape her. He allegedly tried to rape her, which she did not.
######## START OF 000050.MP3 (0:22:52 - 0:23:22s) ########
 He tried to rape her, which she forgot about. It happened in the far 90s. And now she seems to have remembered, but it's not for sure. But the porn actress Stormy Daniels, with whom Trump really had an affair, now assures that putting Donald for sex in prison is some kind of overkill.
######## START OF 000051.MP3 (0:23:20 - 0:23:50s) ########
 Donald Trump was arrested. Arraignment of former President Donald Trump. Trump is officially under arrest. We love Trump! We love Trump! Former President Trump spoke in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, after he was charged with 34 charges. All of this is financial violations. Trump does not admit his guilt in any of these cases. He accused the New York District Attorney in connection with Soros, and who only got out of jail because he promised to put Trump in jail. New York District Attorney
######## START OF 000052.MP3 (0:23:48 - 0:24:18s) ########
 to put Trump in jail. Using Democrats and the judiciary as a tool against their political and ideological opponents is a very real story that deserves attention. But there are other legal problems that may arise in Trump in the coming weeks and months. And the libertarian Americans risk eventually taking the side of the left, too immersed in the legal troubles of Trump. And the legal tribulations.
######## START OF 000053.MP3 (0:24:16 - 0:24:46s) ########
 The case against Trump may affect the US' trust. A large part of Americans, I can't say it's the majority, but a significant part of Americans believe that Trump's prosecution is politically motivated and it may undermine the US' trust in the judicial system, which may lead to, I think, a fall in US trust in general. It's hard to talk about US trust in the economy, but if it does, it's negative. I think it's much more important that this case has drawn all the attention from other issues, whether it's the US southern border, inflation, the rate of growth.
######## START OF 000054.MP3 (0:24:44 - 0:25:14s) ########
 US border, inflation, interest rates, or economic reforms in general. No one discusses anything but Trump. It's every day on the front page. We learned that he will be brought to court on December 4. Therefore, the talks will now be for 9 months ahead. In my opinion, this does not deserve such attention. The trial against Jim Carroll. How strong are the charges against him in this case? They are quite obvious. There are two main parts. The first is slander. What he said.
######## START OF 000055.MP3 (0:25:12 - 0:25:42s) ########
 This is a slander. What he said after he left the presidency. Because there is a case on his comments, which he gave as a president. I blush when I remember what he said during his presidency to slander her. But he said the same thing after his term. He made these statements publicly, so everything is very clear here. According to the new law, she can also file a charge against Trump for rape.
######## START OF 000056.MP3 (0:25:40 - 0:26:10s) ########
 Although, over time, they may be irrelevant. And it will be a series of what she said and what he said. Because she told many people about it in her time. And they will be able to give evidence in her favor. If you see Donald Trump in prison, will it put an end to your story with him? As for my case, I don't think that the crimes he committed against me will be in prison.
######## START OF 000057.MP3 (0:26:08 - 0:26:38s) ########
 I share your point of view that this case is blown up, but we are talking about a serious exceeding of powers, and I think that Stormy Daniels thinks the same, and it was she who was in the center of this storm, if you will, and she thinks that this is all a bit of a mess. Do we really see that the American president will end up in prison for having or not having any relations with the porn star? This is absurd. If we consider all this in context, then we see that Stormy Daniels adheres to her point of view, and Donald Trump adheres to his, and
######## START OF 000058.MP3 (0:26:36 - 0:27:06s) ########
 and Donald Trump is clinging to his own and denies everything. But I think she agrees that in this case, which is considered by the Manhattan Court, there is a place for exceeding authority. We see that the clouds of war are thickening abroad. And I think that American economy and foreign policy are not in the best condition. We have lost all our reputation, which we have built up over the past 233 years. We no longer have any moral right to teach other countries democracy. This is the current policy.
######## START OF 000059.MP3 (0:27:04 - 0:27:34s) ########
 The current policy does not like 51% of people. Therefore, they decided to strike the procedure itself and the candidate for president. What we see is not the end, it's just the beginning. This will be done by three prosecutors and another year and a half. They will wait until he nominates his candidacy in the elections. Then they will ban him from public speech, impose a ban on certain actions, and possibly imprison him to put a cross on his race for the presidential chair. This is the worst example of how the election is involved.
######## START OF 000060.MP3 (0:27:32 - 0:28:02s) ########
 This is a great example of how the elections in third world countries are mixed up. They are in despair, they are afraid of revolution, and it is already going on, although we do not understand it. But the deficit of the federal budget of Germany in 2024 will be at least 14 billion euros, said the Minister of Finance of the country Christian Linder. But incredibly, not far, and obviously the pro-American Chancellor, Schultz, continues to burn billions of German euros for the support of the European Union.

 billion of German euros for the support of the NATO army in Ukraine. Observing such madness, citizens of Germany are in a state of panic, because the rating of the Schultz party has already fallen to an unthinkable minimum. In the political circles of Germany, the Schultz party has already been called the NATO political kamikaze, which, unfortunately, the Germans cannot get rid of until the moment of the explosion itself. The explosion is brewing. Moreover, in Germany itself, directly on the eve of the explosion,

 In Germany, on the eve of the holiday, there were mass anti-war protests. The geography is impressive. Munich, Berlin, Düsseldorf, Leipzig, Hamburg. One of the main demands of the protesters is to stop the supply of weapons to Ukraine. Moreover, the demonstrators arranged a picket at the Ryan Metal defense company, which supplies tanks to Ukraine. Protesters with posters called for a protest came to the gates of the enterprise in the city of Zelle.
######## START OF 000063.MP3 (0:28:56 - 0:29:26s) ########
 with posters calling for a refusal of violence. According to German media, the protesters brought posters with slogans like «Russia is not our enemy», «USA and NATO are out of Ukraine», «Diplomacy is not a weapon». Some also spoke out against the dependence of Europe on US policy. In Berlin, before the march, a song was played. «May there always be sun» in Russian and German.

 The German armed forces are on the streets again. Throughout Germany, thousands of Germans have again taken to the streets to take part in the demonstrations for peace and against the supply of weapons to Ukraine. We simply have to return to diplomacy. We are strongly against any supply of weapons. And because of them, the risk of further escalation and interference in the conflict of new countries only increases. To be continued...

 Green out! We have never been so close to the nuclear war. That's why we are against the arms supply to Ukraine because of the beginning of the peace talks. It's obvious that the US plans to put Russia on its knees. And the Americans are trying to keep their dominance in the world.
######## START OF 000066.MP3 (0:30:20 - 0:30:50s) ########
 Left or right, at the demonstrations for peace in Germany, it no longer plays any role. We found ourselves in an unusual situation, when both the left and the right hold the same views. The right sympathize with Putin, and with the left, they are now united by the fact that they all see the main aggressor in NATO and the main threat to the world. Both the left and the right are convinced that the war began only because the West provoked Russia. And in this their conviction, they are getting closer.

 and their convictions are getting closer and closer. These demonstrations are extremely important. We, Germans, are getting closer to the war. We are becoming more and more aware of the side of the conflict. I am here because I am for peace and against the arms supply to Ukraine.

 The demonstrator in Hannover came to support the outstanding and famous person, former bishop of Hannover Margot Kessmann, who also opposes the Western arms supplies to Ukraine. All of us who went all over Germany to the Easter march of protest do not want the situation in Ukraine to get worse because of the new arms supplies. After all, in the same way as the philosopher Jürgen Habermas noted absolutely correctly, we are also responsible for death and suffering.

Together with other well-known people in Germany, Kessmann signed a petition, which they all demand to immediately stop the supply of weapons to Ukraine and sit down at the negotiating table with Russia. I have been accused several times of being a supporter of Putin and the like. But lately, more and more people have been writing to me. They thank me for my opposition to the supply of weapons to Ukraine. And they are glad that my appeals are getting more and more support in Germany.

American LGBT pastor Mika Luwagi, who was recently appointed the abbot of the Lutheran Church of St. Mark in North Dakota, in her first sermon on Easter, tried to justify the murder of children from Nashville and compared the murder of a transgender with the crucifixion of Christ. Seriously. After reading excerpts from the Bible about the crucifixion of Jesus,
######## START OF 000071.MP3 (0:32:40 - 0:33:10s) ########
 The crucifixion of Jesus was connected with the recent history of the execution of the most terrible. In her speech, she compared the attitude of Pharisees to Jesus with politicians and people who accept and understand the laws against drug shows and transgenders in women's sports. This position is apparently shared by the Biden administration, which now forces all American states to allow boys to participate in women's competitions.

And the emphasis is on the students of the younger classes. Children, so to speak, do not think about competition yet. They do not understand anything about it. By the way, the law that restricts the participation of transgender men in women's competitions is also not allowed by the US.

 The Supreme Court of the United States also canceled the law in West Virginia, which requires athletes to play in a team in accordance with the biological sex. After that, perverts got angry and went on the attack. Aggressive trans-creatures, let's call them so politely, attacked the American swimmer Railey Gaines, who is defending women's normal traditional sport. Gaines was at the event.

However, three years ago, since the bill was introduced, there has been no evidence that trans athletes are harming the sport in Kansas. But there is clear evidence that this bill is harming. It harms both trans youth of our state and all girls who are engaged in competitive sports.

At one time she was a famous swimmer in the student league. She told us how it is to watch such competitions and participate in the swim against the transgender swimmer Leigh Thomas. We saw how Thomas became the winner in the 500-foot freestyle, and lead her from the front to the front.

 Thomas won three of the most famous swimmers in the country. All three are participants in the Olympic Games and the owner of the country's records. Previously, Thomas competed with men and took 462nd place in the overall standings, at best. The next day, Thomas and I competed at 200 feet in freestyle. There was a break of a hundredth of a second between us. Since the federation had only one trophy, they gave it to Thomas. And they said that I would have to go with nothing, and Thomas had to give a trophy for a photo. And I said that I would have to give a trophy for a photo.

Trans rights activists stormed her street. Trans rights activists literally rushed to her after her speech on the protection of women's sports, with which she spoke at the University of San Francisco.

 The police are trying to take her to a safe place, while the protesters are chasing her down the corridors and shouting at her. Riley's husband says that she was hit by a man in a woman's dress several times. Riley joins us. Riley, you know, many people stood up for these protesters, saying that they are fulfilling their right under the first amendment to the US Constitution. But it was under the first amendment, wasn't it? Absolutely.

 Absolutely. Of course, we have the right to protest and freedom of speech. This is the beauty of America. But when this crowd attacked me, it was outside the framework of the protest. It was already a sign of violence, both verbal and physical, in order to prove their point of view. Apparently, there are no other arguments against what I say. They know scientific evidence that is not on their side. That is why they resort to violence. I really worry about my safety. We have people who resort to such methods.
######## START OF 000082.MP3 (0:37:48 - 0:38:18s) ########
 They resort to such methods and we know why they do it. Because they have no rational arguments, no logic, no scientific justification. The common sense is not on their side. It's on my side. Therefore, they resort to violence, whether it is physical or verbal. But it won't stop me. Ukraine said that it will be with Crimea and Donbass in case of, God forbid, the seizure of Donbass, following Danilov's plans for the GDR.

 Danilov has plans to de-Russify Crimea and Donbass. He started building a council building of the Ukrainian President Mikhail Podolyak. He promised that if the territory is returned, this will not happen, but it is important to understand. The residents of Crimea are waiting. We bend our fingers. The ban on the Russian language and culture, Russian passports received by the Russian government,

 All the Russian passports will be repressed as traitors of the country, and all those who disagree with such a policy will be struck in the right. Podolyak voiced all these bold plans against the background of his patron Zelensky's speech, who said that the return of Crimea is a must. Another stubborn Ukrainian, banker Vladimir Yatsenko, has established a super-prize. The conditions are strange. On May 9, a drone with a patriotic inscription or a simple slogan was to be landed on the Red Square.

 By using a heroic slogan, either glorifying Ukraine or insulting Putin, Yatsenko will pay 500 thousand dollars for this heroic feat. Ukrainian patriotism is Putin's insult, ideology and struggle to agree. And not everyone wants to fight it.

What shocked you personally in these documents? I'm not a specialist, I haven't seen anything new. What Zelensky is being listened to, well, let me.

 What are the signs of this conclusion? Well, in terms of the nature of the document, in terms of the text, in terms of the content of the documents, there is no direction. You know, the most important thing in desi, disinformation, is direction. To portray it in such a way as to mislead the opponent. Well, what kind of delusion?

 and you can draw certain conclusions. Of course, it's very difficult for all journalists and experts to do it right away, but with a serious analysis, it's a very good gift for us. It's very unpleasant that someone edited our gift, photoshopped it, in the literal sense of the word. That is, the documents are correct. Before we were given it, we were corrected. This doesn't bother us either. Well, they didn't give it to us. It's not just Russia that is affected.
######## START OF 000101.MP3 (0:46:40 - 0:47:10s) ########

 It's not what it was before, a two-party system. It's a real split. The same thing happens in Europe. We constantly show these rallies. There are regular rallies in Germany now. If we have unity, for example, and we see that 80% support the president, we don't find anything like that in Germany. The lowest ratings are in Macron, in Shultz, and so on. They completely overshadowed everything.

 Ukraine needs to be denazified. When we here in this studio declare this, I understand, but when the Poles start to declare such things, it also does not speak of unity. Now Macron has returned from China and says that we will not support the American point of view on Taiwan. What unity is there in this situation? The coalition is falling apart, everything is very loose, and any serious failure at the front will be destroyed.
######## START OF 000119.MP3 (0:55:04 - 0:55:34s) ########
 A serious failure at the front, which they can already warn about, will seriously break this American coalition, as well as the internal situation in Europe and America.

 How can a small French state be able to incline to something that is 5-6 times more expensive than France? France is increasingly dependent on the Chinese market.

 and even most likely what is not to be said, perhaps even a large-scale military-technical cooperation between China and France will be deployed, France has very interesting technologies, France was thrown out of the AUKUS, as you remember, they are very dissatisfied, France is suffering defeat after defeat, and now strong China offers weakened economic and political France, and the United States is trying to get its own alliance back into the clutches from all sides, and it is agreed that the Southern Command Zone, the capital of the headquarters, is in Guangzhou, just where the MAK-47 flew.

 They are in Guangzhou, where Macron was flying, and they will cooperate with the Pacific group of France. It is not only that he will not condemn the invasion of Taiwan, Macron will not condemn it. Let's read the Chinese Global Times, it says there, an important circumstance. The warm atmosphere of the visit of French President Emmanuel Macron to China disappointed Washington, which hoped that the visit accompanied by the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen will be dedicated not only to cooperation, but also to pressure on China.
######## START OF 000125.MP3 (0:57:52 - 0:58:22s) ########
 but also to put pressure on China. However, at the end of his visit, Macron wrote in social media in three languages, French, Chinese and English, saying hello to the friendship between France and China. This is undoubtedly a blow to the US strategy to persuade the West to contain China. Macron attracted more than 50 entrepreneurs to sign a large number of contracts with Chinese partners to put bilateral trade and economic cooperation at the head of the Chinese-French relations. It can be said that France has played a leading role in the abolition of the US deterrence strategy and its actions.
######## START OF 000126.MP3 (0:58:20 - 0:58:50s) ########
 of the US deterrence strategy and its actions, Paris said no. We'll be back in a minute. So, diplomacy in the spirit of a good and bad policeman named Macron and Fondurla has suffered a fiasco, that's what the headlines of French newspapers say today. Moreover, the negotiations went so badly that the chairman of the CEC sent Fondurla to Europe.
######## START OF 000127.MP3 (0:58:48 - 0:59:18s) ########
 The founder of Europe is almost an economy class. This is also a direct status of the Berlin-Zeitgeist. Macron himself was expected in Paris with another wave of criticism. Not understanding China's position, France sends a rather negative signal to our partners in terms of trust. Emmanuel Macron, without a doubt, believed that he could change the situation and, perhaps, it is worth a try. But after his attempt to dissuade Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine, this is the second failure in diplomatic terms.
######## START OF 000128.MP3 (0:59:16 - 0:59:46s) ########
 Ukraine is the second failure in the diplomatic arena. This has seriously affected the image. Macron remains deaf and mute in the face of the primary security problem in the Indo-Pacific region, namely, stability in the Taiwan Strait. The Yelisey Palace made it clear that this issue will not be considered, except by China's initiative, which is quite surprising. If tomorrow we can no longer travel through the Taiwan Strait on the international trade route, it will directly affect France. We will be in touch in Paris.
######## START OF 000129.MP3 (0:59:44 - 1:00:14s) ########
 We are live with Ekaterina Gadal. Katya, hello. In addition to the wave of criticism that fell on Macron, he brought with him representatives of 50 business companies. What did he bring? Contracts? Are there any concrete achievements? Hello, Olga. He brought, of course, but there are no concrete achievements.
######## START OF 000130.MP3 (1:00:12 - 1:00:42s) ########
 There are no concrete achievements, because the next day, when he was still in China, there was information that Macron confirmed his words. This means that there was no positive information from the Chinese side, otherwise it would be said that Macron and the Chinese have concluded. There are no positive changes and cannot be.
######## START OF 000131.MP3 (1:00:40 - 1:01:10s) ########
 It is obvious that Macron was appointed by the Americans to destroy France. We can see that 15 of the largest enterprises of the former Minister of Economy of Motembur were sold during Macron's reign. This is the first time Macron has been the Minister of Economy. There is no improvement for the French people.
######## START OF 000132.MP3 (1:01:08 - 1:01:38s) ########
 There is no such line of behavior for the French people and French industrialists, and it cannot be, this is not his line of behavior. Katerina, the rhetoric of the French president itself, a little updated in the spirit of criticism of Washington, does it say that Macron has split off or is trying, or at least would like to split off from the United States? Not only, because if he wanted to split off from the United States, he has to do it.
######## START OF 000133.MP3 (1:01:36 - 1:02:06s) ########
 He has all the grounds for that. He is a politician, he is talking about Europe, not France, as a sovereign state. Macron, as a European politician, has more chances for this. In 1966, General de Gaulle brought American soldiers from France. What can't Moscow have? Germany, for example.
######## START OF 000134.MP3 (1:02:04 - 1:02:34s) ########
 Germany, for example. France has its own nuclear weapon, thanks to De Gaulle. France has a place in the Security Council, thanks to the friendship of De Gaulle with the Soviet Union. During Macron's first term, it was said that Macron wanted to give his place in the Security Council to the European Union. This is a direct path to the vassalization of France.
######## START OF 000135.MP3 (1:02:32 - 1:03:02s) ########
 France will be more and more dependent. The fact that Macron gave up the Caesar to Ukraine indicates that the French army, which was once the first army of Europe, is now the Polish army, which is increasingly filled with American weapons. And to this day, France cannot restore the Caesar. When the information was still...
######## START OF 000136.MP3 (1:03:00 - 1:03:30s) ########
 When the information was more open, they said that it would take several years to produce one Cesar in the French industry. It means that it would take decades to produce dozens of Cesar, which Macron gave to Ukraine. What does it mean? Tomorrow France will be involved in a military conflict. It does not have guns, and it will buy these guns from the Americans.
######## START OF 000137.MP3 (1:03:28 - 1:03:58s) ########
 The increase in the French military budget, which was announced by Macron, will go into the pockets of the Americans. They are shooting at the cannons with the old-fashioned term, the cores. Every shot at the core will be a euro, a dollar in the pocket of some American arms manufacturer. Nothing concrete.
######## START OF 000138.MP3 (1:03:56 - 1:04:26s) ########
 There is some rhetoric for voters, but Macron's actions show that he is putting France deeper and deeper into dependence on the Americans. Today, old Europe is becoming less important in Europe.
######## START OF 000139.MP3 (1:04:24 - 1:04:54s) ########
 The most important thing in Europe is that new European countries, such as Poland, the Baltic states, and other countries with higher nationalities, are being filled with more and more weapons. Old Europe is becoming a second plan, and Macron is contributing to this. Thank you very much. Thank you, Ekaterina Gadal, for your live coverage of Paris, France. Olga, I would like to add a few words to Ekaterina.
######## START OF 000140.MP3 (1:04:52 - 1:05:22s) ########
 We need to add a little to Catherine. As a result of the visit, a joint statement was signed, which seems to contain 60 points. And to say that Macron did not bring anything from China is a bit of a mistake. The first point of view is the Airbus, the second line in Tianjin is being built. There is a construction, well, in my telegram channel, there is all this in detail. And Airbus, and construction, and, accordingly, shipbuilding, up to vineyards. That is, the official recognizes the Chinese fault.
######## START OF 000141.MP3 (1:05:20 - 1:05:50s) ########
 The Chinese wine is officially recognized, everything is written there, Chinese take France, so for one minute, literally, two theses. The first one. Indeed, we think that this is a mistake, and the French press scolds Macron that he failed everything there, and this is his conscious policy. He consciously goes, drifts towards China from the United States, and since it was said quite correctly, there is its nuclear weapon, there are no NATO troops.
######## START OF 000142.MP3 (1:05:48 - 1:06:18s) ########
 Macron openly says that there are no NATO troops in France. He has already sold his position on Taiwan for these contracts. This is a bomb of nuclear diplomacy. France is a part of the EU that doesn't care about the Taiwan issue. This is the first point. The second point is that Scholz and other EU leaders have sold their positions much earlier than Macron.
######## START OF 000143.MP3 (1:06:16 - 1:06:46s) ########
 In November, the NATO bases and American troops were located on the territory of Germany. Shultz can't speak so loudly. So, the EU has already surrendered to the US. And the second point. You know, the Chinese influence is spreading at a frightening rate. So, it's France, then Germany, and someone else will fly there. What can the Americans do? This is a situation of a swamp. They must do something. I don't know, maybe a provocation in Taiwan. At the same time, the Chinese influence is spreading, not the Russian one. I don't know.
######## START OF 000144.MP3 (1:06:44 - 1:07:14s) ########
 The Chinese influence is not Russian. It's good that China is on our side in this scenario. We're turning to the topic of whether we should change our hegemony. We can devote another block to this, but I think we don't have enough time. We don't change it. We have long good-neighborly relations with China. We have nothing to share. We have one priority. The collapse of the American-centric system. We get our own directions. The next question is about the details.
######## START OF 000145.MP3 (1:07:12 - 1:07:42s) ########
 Next question is how we will work with the Chinese. We need to build a pragmatic position. As for Macron's behavior, if you believe the newspaper Politico, he tried to declare himself as a third center of power. Let's read. Europe should reduce its dependence on the United States and not engage in confrontation between China and the United States over Taiwan, said French President Emmanuel Macron.
######## START OF 000146.MP3 (1:07:40 - 1:08:10s) ########
 France's Emmanuel Macron. The president of France has won his theory of strategic autonomy for Europe, where France is supposedly at the head. His strategy is to make Europe the third superpower. He also said that the big risk that Europe is facing is that it will fall into crises that are not ours, and this prevents it from building its strategic autonomy. The paradox is that, overwhelmed with panic, we consider ourselves just followers of America, said Macron in an interview. This is a question that Europeans should answer. Is it in our interests to speed up the crisis?
######## START OF 000147.MP3 (1:08:08 - 1:08:38s) ########
 Is it in our interest to speed up the crisis in Taiwan? No. It would be worse to think that we Europeans should be the followers of this topic and take an example from the USA, he said. We'll be back in a minute. Russia's Defense Minister, Shaigui Lukashenko, has said that he had a meeting with Putin in Moscow on the occasion of the visit of the Russian Defense Minister.
######## START OF 000148.MP3 (1:08:36 - 1:09:06s) ########
 In Moscow, in the event of aggression against Minsk, Russia protects its ally as its own territory. Lukashenka asks for such guarantees of security. The Shoygu thanked the Belarusian military for the quality provided for the joint grouping of the military training grounds and stated that he would discuss further presence of Russian military in the country with his Belarusian colleague and possible expansion. Again, whatever it means, the expansion of the military cooperation framework.
######## START OF 000149.MP3 (1:09:04 - 1:09:34s) ########
 The framework of military cooperation. I am grateful to you that you are here despite all the difficulties. Several thousand Russian servicemen. We, as far as it is necessary, have joined this process. And we are preparing together with your officers, these guys, and we are holding a combat meeting. We are preparing as it should be, because we should not relax here.
######## START OF 000150.MP3 (1:09:32 - 1:10:02s) ########
 We should not relax here. You see that the Poles and Lithuanians have begun to move in our direction. Therefore, this is a good support and support for the Belarusian army, which is defending the Union State on the western flank. I would like to express special thanks to your Ministry of Defense. Five training grounds have been provided to you personally in Belarus. They are equipped.
######## START OF 000151.MP3 (1:10:00 - 1:10:30s) ########
 They are equipped, moreover, a sufficient number of instructors and officers are attracted to the Belarusian Armed Forces for training, including our replenishment. Indeed, there is a large enough group here, and we, of course, today will consider all the issues of its further stay and training. Well, and the Chinese gate.
######## START OF 000152.MP3 (1:10:28 - 1:10:58s) ########
 The Chinese Armed Forces have just become known. The footage on your screen has successfully worked out all the tasks and exercises around Taiwan, according to the official statement of the command. German special services are looking for Russian spies in parallel. Allegedly, they and spies use drones to track Ukrainian militants' training at the training ground in Munster. In the last months, the air near the barracks of the Ministry of Defense has become more and more polluted.
######## START OF 000153.MP3 (1:10:56 - 1:11:26s) ########
 In the last months, suspicious drones have been repeatedly spotted in the air near Bundeswehr barracks in Germany. These are the barracks where Ukrainian soldiers are being trained on Western combat systems. In particular, the attempt to espionage was observed in Munster, where the Ukrainians are being trained to manage the BMP Marder and the Leopard 2 tanks. The leadership of the Bundeswehr is extremely concerned and wants to invest more in technology for fighting drones. Right now, special means are being used by the Bundeswehr to suppress drones.
######## START OF 000154.MP3 (1:11:24 - 1:11:54s) ########
 Last summer Berlin started to buy new equipment of this type, because there are too few special equipment for defense. Please. We will, of course, continue to monitor, not only from drones. In the end, you train them against whom? Against the Russian army? It is clear that we are generally interested in what you are doing there and how you are preparing. In this regard, by the way, the Russophobic Times newspaper suddenly drew a conclusion, having talked to the Ukrainians.
######## START OF 000155.MP3 (1:11:52 - 1:12:22s) ########
 The conclusion of the conversation with the Ukrainians, which says, and the Russians are not fools, you know, they study all these instructions of NATO, which you supply these very Ukrainian soldiers. Well, it's good. And about Macron, you know, well, that's what it means, they tore him off the watcher of the commissar, yes, and allowed himself several statements in her absence, under control. Now he will return to Europe anyway, and will speak differently again.
######## START OF 000156.MP3 (1:12:20 - 1:12:50s) ########
 He says, tomorrow the main host of Europe, Biden, will come to Ireland, to Northern Ireland. What am I talking about? And here he shows the miracles of how to communicate with his allies. The humiliation he is preparing for the British when he refuses to go to the coronation of Charles III, because he is too old for these trips.
######## START OF 000157.MP3 (1:12:48 - 1:13:18s) ########
 But he goes to Ireland, where he will spend almost a week, riding on the Irish land. This is an indicator of how to treat his allies. At the same time, the American media, first of all, of course, democratically report that there was a preparation of a terrorist attack against the American president, was prevented in Ireland. It was the program 60 minutes, Vesti, see you.
