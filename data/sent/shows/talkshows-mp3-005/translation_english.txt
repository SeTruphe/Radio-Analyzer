 ANCHORS ON A RECORD ANCHORS ON A RECORD ANCHORS ON A RECORD ANCHORS ON A RECORD ANCHORS ON A RECORD ANCHORS ON A RECORD ANCHORS ON A RECORD 60 Minutes is on air, and the main thing is... Hello, dear friends and comrades. Well, there is no need for a general mobilization in Russia. A partial mobilization will be completed in exactly two weeks. The CIS Summit has announced this.
######## START OF 000002.MP3 (0:00:28 - 0:00:58s) ########
 According to the President, the army has already called on 222,000 people, some of them, 33,000, are in the units, 16,000 are already performing combat missions. One contract army to hold the front line at 1,100 kilometers was not enough. This is the reason for partial mobilization. All initial mistakes in mobilization were associated with old forms of accounting.
######## START OF 000003.MP3 (0:00:56 - 0:01:26s) ########
 ...with old forms of accounting, are they all corrected or are they being corrected right now? Putin's press secretary, on the issue of the loot of military commissaries in Moscow and St. Petersburg, said, don't be afraid to go to Moscow, you need to, if anything, turn to the General Prosecutor's Office. We listen to Putin carefully. Should we expect a new wave of mobilization? Will there be a general mobilization? Nothing additional is planned.
######## START OF 000004.MP3 (0:01:24 - 0:01:54s) ########
 We do not plan to do this in addition. No offers from the Ministry of Defence have been made for this purpose. I do not see any need for this in the foreseeable future. This work is already coming to an end. Now, there are 222,000 people mobilised in the troops of the armoured forces out of 300,000. I think that all mobilisation activities will be completed in about two weeks. The contact line is 1,100 kilometres.
######## START OF 000005.MP3 (0:01:52 - 0:02:22s) ########
 Therefore, it is almost impossible to keep it exclusively with troops formed from contractors, especially since they are actively involved in offensive operations. This is what mobilisation is about. Second, citizens who are called upon to mobilise must undergo training. This is how it works. As I said, there are now 222,000 troops, or rather, in the so-called armed forces.
######## START OF 000006.MP3 (0:02:20 - 0:02:50s) ########
 More precisely, in the so-called formation units. There, the primary training lasts from 5 to 10 days. Then, depending on the military accounting specialty, they are sent to the combat units. And there is training from 5 to 15 days. Then the next stage is directly in the troops taking part in the combat actions. And there is additional training. As I said, we have 222,000 troops.
######## START OF 000007.MP3 (0:02:48 - 0:03:18s) ########
 We have 33,000 mobilized people in the military units, and 16,000 in the units that are engaged in combat missions. To the question of my colleague from the newspaper Kommersant, Andrey Kolesnikov, Putin answered briefly, no. We are talking about special operations.
######## START OF 000008.MP3 (0:03:16 - 0:03:46s) ########
 The President said that what was happening was not pleasant, but if Russia had not started the CIO, it would have received the same, but a little later and in much worse conditions. That is, our army worked on a warning. At the same time, Russia, according to the President, does not set the task of destroying Ukraine. The original data are the same. Neutral status and recognition of new Russian regions. Putin said that there is no point in further massive shelling of Ukraine.
######## START OF 000009.MP3 (0:03:44 - 0:04:14s) ########
 There is no point. But he added, «Not yet, not yet» – this is a quote. The goal of the Russian strikes was to defeat 29 critical infrastructure facilities. At the moment, 22 facilities have been completely destroyed. The remaining 7, quote, are being taken by the Ministry of Defense. Today, Russian calibers are being launched from the arsenal of Western weapons in the Lviv region. Putin also said that the FSB stated that the explosion was a military one.
######## START OF 000010.MP3 (0:04:12 - 0:04:42s) ########
 stated that the explosives for the terrorist attack on the Crimean bridge were sent by sea from Odessa. But it is not yet known whether the grain depot was used for this. If it turns out that humanitarian corridors have become part of the terrorist scheme, this will put the grain deal into question, to put it mildly. Quote, we will close it and that's it, said the president. Vladimir Vladimirovich, you...
######## START OF 000011.MP3 (0:04:40 - 0:05:10s) ########
 Mr Putin, do you regret anything? No. I want to make it clear. What is happening today is not pleasant, to put it mildly. But we would get the same result a little later, only in worse conditions for us. That's all. So we are acting right and timely. Will Ukraine exist? But we did not set ourselves the task of destroying Ukraine. No, of course not. They have taken Crimea in their time.
######## START OF 000012.MP3 (0:05:08 - 0:05:38s) ########
 At one time, 2.5 million people lived in Crimea, 2.4 million. They took it and cut off the water. The troops had to go in and open the water in Crimea. This is just an example of the logic of our actions. If we did not take this action, there would be no other countermeasures. The bridge was blown up. Now we need to think 10 times.
######## START OF 000013.MP3 (0:05:36 - 0:06:06s) ########
 and ensuring communication with Crimea on the territory. How important is this for the Russian Federation? Well, the Russian President said that as soon as the Russian troops, we remember, left Kiev, the Ukrainian authorities suddenly lost the desire to hold at least some negotiations. However, our position remains absolutely unchanged. Who is against negotiations? We know, Biden and Johnson.
######## START OF 000014.MP3 (0:06:04 - 0:06:34s) ########
 We know Biden and Johnson. By the way, Putin addressed the West separately. The German authorities called them American puppets, who ignore the well-being of their people in favor of NATO and Washington. Commenting on the possibility of NATO troops entering Ukraine, the President urged the West not to take steps that could lead to a global catastrophe. Today is just 60 years to the Caribbean crisis. Are you ready to talk to Biden?
######## START OF 000015.MP3 (0:06:32 - 0:07:02s) ########
 Are you ready to communicate? – asked Putin. We need to ask him whether he is ready to hold such negotiations with me or not. I do not see the need, to be honest. As long as there is no platform for negotiations, my trip there has not been finalized. Russia will certainly take part in this work. We will think about the format.
######## START OF 000016.MP3 (0:07:00 - 0:07:30s) ########
 What format will we think about? We have not discussed such issues with the US President, as long as there is no direct negotiations with anyone from the participants of the two retreats. Is it possible that NATO is leading troops into the territory of Ukraine? The deployment of some troops directly in contact with the Russian army is a very dangerous step.
######## START OF 000017.MP3 (0:07:28 - 0:07:58s) ########
 This is a very dangerous step that can lead to a global catastrophe. I hope that the mind of those who talk about this will have enough to not take such dangerous steps. Russia has transferred nuclear bombings to the borders of Norway. This is reported by local media with a link to satellite images of the private company Planet Labs. The images from October 7 show 7 Tu-160 and 4 Tu-95.
######## START OF 000018.MP3 (0:07:56 - 0:08:26s) ########
 Two days later, the satellite recorded another Tu-160 on the runway of the airbase. The Norwegian edition writes that usually these Russian birds are based 720 kilometers southeast of Moscow. And in Europe there was a panic, although the reason for it, it seems, should not be. In the sense that the US Defense Minister Lloyd Austin stated, NATO is not a threat to Russia and is not looking for confrontation with Russia.
######## START OF 000019.MP3 (0:08:24 - 0:08:54s) ########
 and does not seek confrontation with Russia. However, he added that NATO and the United States consider Russia's victory over Ukraine as their defeat. And according to the Pentagon, there is no contradiction in these two messages. Nothing supernatural is seen in the West in nuclear exercises Stolka and Polding, which are aimed at working out a nuclear war with Russia. They will be held next week. The Alliance's statement says that participation in them is...
######## START OF 000020.MP3 (0:08:52 - 0:09:22s) ########
 The Alliance's statement says that 14 countries and up to 60 military aircraft will participate in it. The goal is to work out the application of the American B-61 nuclear bombs, placed in the warehouses of European bases, on the border with Russia. Details of NATO exercises were revealed in the White House today. Vice Admiral Kirby said that the tests of NATO's nuclear power will be carried out thousands of kilometers from the Russian border.
######## START OF 000021.MP3 (0:09:20 - 0:09:50s) ########
 from the Russian border and asked not to worry. The launch of nuclear warheads will be virtual, not real. The rounds will be exclusively blank. We are talking about American nuclear missiles and bombs from the US arsenal. At the moment, these bombs are deployed in Europe, Turkey, Northern Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Moscow, in turn, will also very politely release the bomb.
######## START OF 000022.MP3 (0:09:48 - 0:10:18s) ########
 NATO has also very politely issued a notification about the closure of a number of areas in the Barents Sea, where large-scale military exercises with combat shooting will be held. We are most likely talking about another stage of testing of promising weapons samples. I suppose that it will be the RS-28 Sarmat, the so-called Russian sword of revenge. And a special request to NATO not to worry.
######## START OF 000023.MP3 (0:10:16 - 0:10:46s) ########
 Don't worry, the Sarmatians will be idle. But this is not for sure. By the way, today is the 60th anniversary of the beginning of the Caribbean crisis. On this day, in 1962, an American reconnaissance aircraft detected Soviet missiles on the Kuma. A tense political and military confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States began. Before that, the world was never so close to a nuclear war. But apparently, peace.
######## START OF 000024.MP3 (0:10:44 - 0:11:14s) ########
 But, apparently, the world has forgotten everything. NATO and Russia will hold military exercises next week. General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said that the Western Alliance will closely monitor the forces of Moscow. The Russian Federation is preparing for the next exercise. The Russian Federation is preparing for the next exercise. The Russian Federation is preparing for the next exercise. NATO is going to start exercises next week.
######## START OF 000025.MP3 (0:11:12 - 0:11:42s) ########
 Next week, NATO is going to start the exercise of the Air Force, capable of carrying nuclear weapons. All this should be carried out within the framework of the long-planned annual exercises, which will be held despite the escalation of tensions between the West and Russia. According to the US and the press, the aircraft will not be equipped with bombs, and the exercises themselves will be held at a distance of more than 600 miles from the Russian border. It turns out that this is a regular or periodic event, which was planned even before Russia invaded Ukraine.
######## START OF 000026.MP3 (0:11:40 - 0:12:10s) ########
 before Russia invaded Ukraine. So it's not a response to what's happening. Maybe it's a little bit obtrusive in the current situation, but it's already there. The NATO defense ministers have also gathered to discuss possible counterattacks in case of a nuclear attack on NATO territory. Moscow continues to threaten with its nuclear weapons. Regular Russian missile tests can also be perceived as a threat. And that's why NATO is starting... That's why NATO is starting...
######## START OF 000027.MP3 (0:12:08 - 0:12:38s) ########
 That's why NATO is starting its annual exercises next week. The purpose of the exercises, among other things, is to make sure that in case of a serious threat, for example, fighters based in Germany, could instantly rise in the air and drop US nuclear weapons over the territories of a potential enemy. The focus of Vladimir Putin's serious threat is to use nuclear weapons. Let's look at the Russian nuclear arsenal. TASTY DIALOGUE WITH ELENA BAZHENOVA
######## START OF 000028.MP3 (0:12:36 - 0:13:06s) ########
 Russia currently has more nuclear weapons than any other country in the world. The real numbers are kept secret, but intelligence services have determined this number at about 6,000 warheads. The vast majority of them are so-called strategic nuclear weapons, usually placed in intercontinental ballistic missiles. It is part of the nuclear deterrence strategy, military experts say.
######## START OF 000029.MP3 (0:13:04 - 0:13:34s) ########
 Military experts say that the government would not attack the country with the weapons of the ship of the day. Taking into account their unrivaled power and the general border of Ukraine and Russia, experts believe that Moscow is unlikely to use strategic nuclear weapons. However, there is another option, tactical nuclear weapons. No one is saying that this will happen. This is just an assumption about how Russia could use weapons. It can simply wipe out all these territories from the map.
######## START OF 000030.MP3 (0:13:32 - 0:14:02s) ########
 It can just wipe out all these territories from the battlefield. And the right tool will be the tactical nuclear weapon. You were in this field in the 80s. What did the US think and understand before the possibility of limited use of nuclear weapons? We recognize that the tactical nuclear weapon was not a deterrent. We planned something like that. At that time, we had tactical nuclear missiles, successfully located in Germany. We are going to use them in case of retreat or defeat.
######## START OF 000031.MP3 (0:14:00 - 0:14:30s) ########
 to prevent them from retreating or losing in a possible war as the Russian troops advance. We needed the nuclear weapon to deter the Russian troops from a potential offensive. Again, this would make this land lifeless. And when the Russian troops pass through the so-called nuclear wasteland, they will suffer even greater losses. NATO poses no threat to Russia, does not seek confrontation with Russia. But our defensive alliance, as it has always been, is defending the Russian land.
######## START OF 000032.MP3 (0:14:28 - 0:14:58s) ########
 It's good, as it has always been, that every inch of NATO territory is protected. The British Defence Minister Ben Wallace scolded President Macron for his premature disclosure of his position on the issue of nuclear weapons. I would like to remind you that Macron said the day before that a nuclear strike on Ukraine would not put France in direct danger. Therefore, France's military doctrine does not imply a nuclear strike on Ukraine.
######## START OF 000033.MP3 (0:14:56 - 0:15:26s) ########
 France does not have a symmetrical answer. It also called for less talk about the nuclear threat and to make more efforts for peace. According to Wallace, Macron opened his cards, and this, of course, is Putin's scenario. Joseph Borrello got it too. The main diplomat, it turns out, did not have the authority to speak out about the options of the West's response to the alleged possible use of nuclear weapons by Russia in Ukraine. Said a high-ranking European official.
######## START OF 000034.MP3 (0:15:24 - 0:15:54s) ########
 A well-established European official is a journalist for the Wall Street Journal. Zelensky is celebrating the Day of Fall, the day of Hitler's accomplices from the Ukrainian insurgent army. And the citizens of Ukraine are not at all before the holiday. They are forced to save electricity by their regime's demands. The problems with electricity continue in most regions of Ukraine. In the city of Lviv, where more than four power substations are destroyed and not to be restored, the authorities have already given an order to stock up on electricity.
######## START OF 000035.MP3 (0:15:52 - 0:16:22s) ########
 The authorities have already ordered to stock up on barley and firewood for the winter. Meanwhile, Russia continues to strike at energy infrastructure facilities. As Putin said, we are taking the facilities. Four explosions took place in Kharkov. The city mayor confirmed that these were the impacts of the TETS-2. The light went out. Air alarm has been announced in the central and southern regions of Ukraine. Kamikadze drones are being spotted in Kiev and Odessa.
######## START OF 000036.MP3 (0:16:20 - 0:16:50s) ########
 In Kiev, Odessa, Nikolaevsk and Zaporozhye regions, CNN does not have a clue. Russia has hundreds of such drones and more than 2,000 pre-ordered machines. According to the Americans, Iran is not just selling its Kamikaze drones to Russia. According to the new report of the Institute for the Study of War, members of the Iranian Corps of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution are in the fields and help the Russians with the geraniums. For more information, visit the website of the Institute for the Study of War.
######## START OF 000037.MP3 (0:16:48 - 0:17:18s) ########
 Russian air strikes hit key facilities around Kiev. Ukrainian police say that three kamikaze drones produced by Iran hit infrastructure facilities. This week alone, strikes hit 30 percent of the country's electricity infrastructure, which led to the shutdown of 12 more power plants.
######## START OF 000038.MP3 (0:17:16 - 0:17:46s) ########
 12 more energy facilities were damaged. New round of attacks on the capital of Ukraine. Officials say that kamikaze drones produced by Iran hit objects around Kiev. One of the high-ranking officials said that the strikes came on a critically important infrastructure. It is very upsetting to hear about these Iranian kamikaze drones, which Russia is deploying. We do not know whether Iran is deploying them.
######## START OF 000039.MP3 (0:17:44 - 0:18:14s) ########
 How do we know about that? Is Iran supplying them? What's the background there? Yes, that's what the Ukrainians are saying. They say that Iranians have supplied Russia with hundreds of these kamikaze drones. They call them kamikaze because these drones are capable of flying over enemy positions and explode there. And in the last few weeks we've seen that the Russians use these drones more often than rockets. And they hit positions in the depths of Ukraine.
######## START OF 000040.MP3 (0:18:12 - 0:18:42s) ########
 The experts say that Russia launches these drones from positions controlled by the image. And they attack cities and towns far from the front line. The Minister of Energy of Ukraine said that the Russian strikes damaged about one third of the country's energy infrastructure. Winter is coming. How is Kiev preparing for the cold and the upcoming season? That's a very good question. And the Ukrainians say that they are preparing for the cold.
######## START OF 000041.MP3 (0:18:40 - 0:19:10s) ########
 And Ukrainians say that this is the Russian tactics, so they attack key infrastructure. As the Minister of Energy said, one third of the country's energy infrastructure was damaged, and in some parts of the country there was a power outage. The authorities are working to restore the infrastructure, and they called on citizens to reduce their energy consumption by an hour. But the question remains, as winter approaches, how will these attacks continue, and how will this infrastructure be protected?
######## START OF 000042.MP3 (0:19:08 - 0:19:38s) ########
 The infrastructure is going to be protected. It's the third one. Because of these Iranian drones, Ukrainians are under a new form of attack.
######## START OF 000043.MP3 (0:19:36 - 0:20:06s) ########
 On the 4th of July we witnessed a particularly intense series of Russian strikes. It happened on Monday. These strikes destroyed part of the energy infrastructure of the country in Lviv, in the west of the country. Yes, a large part of the Ukrainian territory was damaged to some extent. The authorities say that 30% of the energy infrastructure was damaged, which is why the export of electricity had to be stopped.
######## START OF 000044.MP3 (0:20:04 - 0:20:34s) ########
 which forced the power to be stopped. It is clear that the system is damaged and it is unknown whether the authorities will be able to keep their promise and not resort to the correct power cut. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg confirmed in his speech that the West has heard Vladimir Zelensky's call to supply more funds to the World Trade Organization. This will be the main priority of the Alliance. The first RST complex from Germany has already been delivered to Kiev. Stoltenberg confirmed once again.
######## START OF 000045.MP3 (0:20:32 - 0:21:02s) ########
 Stoltenberg thus once again confirmed that Ukraine has long been out of business. We are fighting NATO on its territory. These are very serious opponents. However, there are also gaps in the ranks of NATO. Elon Musk's company has appealed to the Pentagon to pay the bills for the services of Starlink satellites in Ukraine. By the end of the year, the company will have to spend more than $120 million, and the next $400 million.
######## START OF 000046.MP3 (0:21:00 - 0:21:30s) ########
 $400 million. That is, Musk directly says to the Pentagon, pay for it yourself, I pass. Musk even complained on Twitter that he had already given $80 million for this operation. The appetite of Ukrainians is growing. The commander of the hostaged air force directly addressed Musk and asked for another 8,000 Starlink terminals. After all, the monthly Russian army destroys at least 500 pieces.
######## START OF 000047.MP3 (0:21:28 - 0:21:58s) ########
 500 of them. In Ukraine, out of the reluctance of the American businessman to fulfill all the desires of the Kiev regime, they made a traditional conclusion. He is Putin's agent and a Russian spy. Musk got on the peacekeeping website, is accused of an attempt to territorial integrity of Ukraine and attempts to legalize the annexation of Crimea by Russia. That is, now it is not Musk, but Moscow. And Ukrainian ungratefulness and rudeness to him.
######## START OF 000048.MP3 (0:21:56 - 0:22:26s) ########
 He was fed up with the order. Today it turned out that officials in Ukraine should not send their benefactors to three letters. Even to former ambassadors. Musk wrote that he refused to deliver Starlink to Kiev after Andrey Melnik advised him to go to these three letters. That is, Musk just followed his recommendations. Nothing personal. He can no longer pay for Ukrainian Starlink.
######## START OF 000049.MP3 (0:22:24 - 0:22:54s) ########
 He can not pay for the Ukrainian Starlink. I will become visible. The company Elon Musk, Space X, has applied to the US Department of Defense, to take over the financing of satellites in Ukraine. CNN notes that the appeal to the Pentagon was written against the background of recent news about the large-scale interruptions in the work of Starlink in the areas where the USSR operates during the active counteroffensive.
######## START OF 000050.MP3 (0:22:52 - 0:23:22s) ########
 The US Air Force is in the middle of an active counteroffensive. According to the reports, this has resulted in catastrophic losses of communication. In the fight against the invaders, one of the most critical technological components does not fire missiles and does not fire bullets. These are small and simple access points to the Internet called Starlink. They are produced by SpaceX, a company that deals with space rockets and satellites. It is led by Elon Musk. According to SpaceX, there are about 20,000 terminals in Ukraine.
######## START OF 000051.MP3 (0:23:20 - 0:23:50s) ########
 There are about 20,000 Starlink terminals, and they are vital for communication between soldiers, drones and artillery. Starlink is the glue that connects reconnaissance drones and artillery, which hits Russian positions. Starlink arrived in Ukraine immediately after the war began. The whole world was grateful for this mask. CNN's offices found documents that say that SpaceX is only part of the global efforts to help Ukraine at the front. But now, seven months after the war began, SpaceX warns the Pentagon.
######## START OF 000052.MP3 (0:23:48 - 0:24:18s) ########
 SpaceX warns Pentagon that the company faces a tough choice to either reduce the volume of services or stop Starlink altogether. It's a difficult choice of reducing or stopping service. Why is this question raised now? It's not the best time. It's just, it's really bad timing. The company says it has spent about $100 million and adds, quote, We are not in a position to continue to transfer terminals for free or finance already transferred terminals indefinitely. SpaceX
######## START OF 000053.MP3 (0:24:16 - 0:24:46s) ########
 The Pentagon asked SpaceX to take over most of the costs, $124 million, by the end of 2022. Based on this amount, it can be concluded that by 2023 this figure will be $400 million. Without Starlink, Ukraine says it cannot fight. Last week, there were reports of sudden and all-out failures of Starlink services at the frontlines in Ukraine. Elon Musk has disappointed us all today.
######## START OF 000054.MP3 (0:24:44 - 0:25:14s) ########
 Today he was a little disappointed. Now, as we say in Galicia, something is in his head, something is floating there. The stomach is swimming. He starts to leave horns to everyone. This is a very strange behavior from Musk. Musk is a hypocrite. And he looks very, very ugly in this situation. Also not beautiful. Musk is worried that he will have to spend a lot of money. He will go bankrupt. He will go bankrupt. It is not known how long the war will last. After his tweets, he already thought, the Ukrainians will probably be afraid.
######## START OF 000055.MP3 (0:25:12 - 0:25:42s) ########
 Probably, Ukrainians will fight to the end. He was scared and decided that he would not pay so much for Starlink. SpaceX has the audacity to look like a hero when others pay so much. And now it is putting a bill of tens of millions of dollars a month. Starlink Elon Musk says that he can no longer afford to provide Ukraine with free services. And asks the Pentagon to pay for it. This happened a few days after Ukrainian Ambassador Andrei Melnik wrote to Musk,
######## START OF 000056.MP3 (0:25:40 - 0:26:10s) ########
 We just followed his recommendations. In general, unlike the offended liver sausage of Sholtz, who rubbed himself after the insults and still supplies weapons to the Air Force, Musk will not tolerate the rudeness of the Ukrainian diplomat. He will no longer pay the bills of Kiev for the Internet. Today, a coincidence, the Air Force has just begun to work.
######## START OF 000057.MP3 (0:26:08 - 0:26:38s) ########
 The problems with the Internet connection have just begun. He wrote a three-letter message to the American businessman about Melnik's offer. He returned to Zelensky with a boomerang. He voiced his claims, struck by the extreme audacity and simplicity of the Ukrainian president, the host of Fox News, Tucker Carlson. His new demand from Zelensky, the collective West, is to allocate another $5 billion to the Kiev regime.
######## START OF 000058.MP3 (0:26:36 - 0:27:06s) ########
 and 5 billion dollars a year. Tucker called Zelensky a dictator of one of the most corrupt countries in Europe, a brazen foreigner in a T-shirt and a troll. Then he suggested he go to hell. Vladimir Zelensky, this famous politician, is a dictator of one of the most corrupt countries in Europe. Zelensky is now trying to shake out even more money from our cowardly Congress.
######## START OF 000059.MP3 (0:27:04 - 0:27:34s) ########
 when our own economy, our own borders are being destroyed. Look. At the moment, our country has two key financial needs. This is $38 billion to pay off the budget deficit for next year and another $17 billion confirmed by the World Bank to restore the critically important infrastructure. We also need targeted loans of $2 billion
######## START OF 000060.MP3 (0:27:32 - 0:28:02s) ########
 of the electric energy infrastructure and the expansion of the export of electricity to Europe. We also need to set a credit limit for the purchase of gas and coal for the upcoming heating season. The amount of financial support this year should be at least 5 billion dollars. What? A sluggish foreigner in a T-shirt asking for money for his economy, which is in a critical state? Bro, ours is in the same state. Who are you? A troll? Go away! Since when is this a problem?
######## START OF 000061.MP3 (0:28:00 - 0:28:30s) ########
 Go away! Since when does this guy claim our treasuries? We owe nothing to this guy. Nothing! Good luck, buddy! And while our economy is degrading and the border is gone, this guy is giving us a list of Christmas presents. I want this, I want that, I want a bike. You better give it to him and fast! Right? Here you go, bro. Tucker Carlson understands that most Western politicians will not succeed.
######## START OF 000062.MP3 (0:28:28 - 0:28:58s) ########
 Ukraine is so used to the idea that it owes everything to it, that it has become a national idea. And the Kiev regime sincerely believes that all the help of the West will be free for the beautiful eyes. But this feeling is false. For the American Lend-a-Liz and for European aid, you will have to pay. And with interest. But Zelensky continues to ask. The NATO Agency promised Zelensky a hundred stations that would shut down the work of the security services.
######## START OF 000063.MP3 (0:28:56 - 0:29:26s) ########
 which will shut down the work of the drones. But the ZE itself will probably ask Erdogan and Bayraktar. The President of Turkey met with Putin the day before. The main result is that the international gas hub in Turkey will be. Erdogan said that he and Putin entrusted their energy ministries to start working as soon as possible. The point is that the Turkish stream remains the only reliable pipeline route for gas supplies to Europe. Therefore, the President...
######## START OF 000064.MP3 (0:29:24 - 0:29:54s) ########
 Therefore, the President proposed to make a separate hub on the Turkish border to supply the desired gas through it. Turkish media rightly note that the eyes of the whole world were blindfolded in the conversation between Putin and Erdogan, and call the negotiations a quote of dizzying diplomacy, although they were talking about gas supplies. It is difficult not to agree. Turkey not only opposes Western sanctions, but also opposes the Russian sanctions.
######## START OF 000065.MP3 (0:29:52 - 0:30:22s) ########
 Turkey not only opposes Western sanctions, but also finds ways to benefit from them. This year, the volume of trade between the two countries has already exceeded $50 billion, which is a new record. Previously, there was $34 billion in force for the entire 21st year. Politico magazine released a rating of people who, in the best way, influenced the creation of a green agenda in the EU. Vladimir Putin, who started the special operation, is the head of the rating.
######## START OF 000066.MP3 (0:30:20 - 0:30:50s) ########
 Putin, who started a special operation in Ukraine and, quote, manipulated the energy supplies, achieved what the generation of green activists could not achieve. Putin began his two-day visit to Astana, where he took part in the summit of 27 Asian countries. On the first day, he held a meeting...
######## START OF 000067.MP3 (0:30:48 - 0:31:18s) ########
 On the first day, he held a number of meetings with the leaders of the Middle East countries. At the meeting with his Turkish colleague, Putin tried to bend Erdogan to the plan of supplying more Russian gas through Turkey against the backdrop of the break-through with supplies to Europe. We all have a hard time experiencing the consequences of the crisis in Ukraine, both regionally and globally. I always say that a just world can be established with the help of diplomacy, that there are no winners and losers in the war. We need a just world. We have not heard any...
######## START OF 000068.MP3 (0:31:16 - 0:31:46s) ########
 We haven't heard any details about the renewal of diplomatic steps of Erdogan and what Vladimir Putin thinks about this. When the two leaders appeared in front of the cameras for a short time, they focused on energy security, and Putin proposed that Russia export more gas from Turkey to the EU countries after the leak in the pipeline of the Northern Stream, in fact, turning Turkey into a hub for Russian gas. Of course, he is well aware that many European countries have been trying to find a way to the EU in recent months.
######## START OF 000069.MP3 (0:31:44 - 0:32:14s) ########
 Countries are trying to find an alternative to Russian gas. I think that one aspect is the relations between Turkey and Russia, which are developing in a very positive direction. Cooperation in the energy sector is strengthening. Turkey offers the role of the third party to de-escalate the situation between Ukraine and Russia. There is also a common understanding of some other regional issues. So there is progress in bilateral relations between Moscow and Ankara. However, there is also growing criticism from the Russian side.
######## START OF 000070.MP3 (0:32:12 - 0:32:42s) ########
 However, the criticism from the EU and the USA is growing in relation to strengthening these relations. So, of course, in order to strengthen relations between Ankara and the West, Turkey should also play a role in de-escalating the situation in Ukraine and Russia. I am sure that while negotiations on security and energy issues are underway, Ukraine will certainly be on the agenda. So far, Turkey has achieved certain diplomatic successes in reaching a deal on grain. And I think that the deal between Putin and Erdogan will continue,
######## START OF 000071.MP3 (0:32:40 - 0:33:10s) ########
 The Russian president has proposed the idea of energy transition through Turkey. This is a very specific proposal that can help reduce tensions in Europe, especially in terms of the availability of gas and energy. This is very important. I think that Europeans will follow the development of this proposal. Breaking news. The Russian part of the joint group of forces will soon begin to arrive in Belarus. We know that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Makay, has announced today that the Russian part of the group of forces will arrive in Belarus.
######## START OF 000072.MP3 (0:33:08 - 0:33:38s) ########
 The Belarusian MAK reporter said today that the country is undergoing a counter-terrorist operation. This is due to a threat from Ukraine. Let's move to the front. Our front correspondent, military reporter Alexander Sladkov is in touch. Sasha, it's clear that the main news came from the Russian President Putin. First, he said that the partial mobilization would end in two weeks. Will there be no more mobilizations in the country?
######## START OF 000073.MP3 (0:33:36 - 0:34:06s) ########
 Putin said that there will be no mass strikes in Ukraine. He also said that we do not need mass strikes in Ukraine yet. There are other tasks. It is difficult to comment on the words of the President. Nevertheless, what tasks are we talking about? What is the priority for us now as part of a special military operation? It is difficult to comment on the words of the President.
######## START OF 000074.MP3 (0:34:04 - 0:34:34s) ########
 I think that the first is the security of the Russian territories, that is, Zaporizhia, Kherson, Donbass, these are certainly those areas that are bordered with Ukraine and are under artillery and missile strikes from the USSR. And, of course, this is a more stable situation on the front for us, and the defense where we need it, where it is necessary,
######## START OF 000075.MP3 (0:34:32 - 0:35:02s) ########
 It is necessary to move forward and complete the whole operation that we started on February 23-24. But the goal has not been removed, the goals remain the same. Therefore, we still have a lot of tests ahead, but I hope, and the President hopes, I decipher his words, that this will all be completed in order. By the way, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation...
######## START OF 000076.MP3 (0:35:00 - 0:35:30s) ########
 Putin said that the Ministry of Defense believes that more mobilization should not be carried out. Therefore, in principle, the President cited the topic raised by the Ministry of Defense about the restriction of such events. I want to tell you, if we prepare well, this will be enough for the eyes of people. We will prepare people well, they will be provided. I'll just give an example.
######## START OF 000077.MP3 (0:35:28 - 0:35:58s) ########
 I'll just give an example. I'll describe it figuratively. So, the shooting from the drone, from above, the enemy's position, and everything around is in craters. What does it mean? It means that we don't hit the targets that the scouts or our intelligence systems give us, if they exist. We pour ammunition like peas. So, we deliver them to the enemy.
######## START OF 000078.MP3 (0:35:56 - 0:36:26s) ########
 We deliver them, unload, hide, transport, bring to artillery positions. If we have what we need, we will hit and solve the issue with much less force. I have described the desire of all actions of the group. We are moving towards this. People acquire experience, equipment, technical equipment.
######## START OF 000079.MP3 (0:36:24 - 0:36:54s) ########
 Equipment and technical support is growing today, it is really so. We are 7 miles away from the pit we found ourselves in. Look how much we have already actively mobilized. After all, the enemy has had a much more painful time for society, for the mobilized themselves. And Ukraine has incurred so much costs that even the heartbroken EU ...
######## START OF 000080.MP3 (0:36:52 - 0:37:22s) ########
 Even the Orphaned Union of Ukraine takes on the role of providing, serving and educating all those mobilized people in Ukraine. We are coping on our own, our people are coming, very interesting people are coming here. I am honestly pleased to look at them. Of course, my heart is pounding that they are in danger.
######## START OF 000081.MP3 (0:37:20 - 0:37:50s) ########
 They are in danger, they are going to the front. It's a pity to lose such people for the Motherland, if something happens. But they are now protecting us, and it just warms my heart, honestly. Sasha, how is the situation in Kherson? There are reports that the enemy is pulling some incredible forces there, tens of thousands of ISF-2 fighters are concentrated there.
######## START OF 000082.MP3 (0:37:48 - 0:38:18s) ########
 The authorities of Kherson region say that they are asking a certain number of people to leave to avoid shelling. What is going on there? We are always concerned about how people will think about us. This is normal for any society, for any person.
######## START OF 000083.MP3 (0:38:16 - 0:38:46s) ########
 Nevertheless, we say, guys, danger, who wants, he must leave. This is one. The second, Kherson is a regional city, 60,010 divisions, believe my little experience, it is impossible to take the city with such forces. It is impossible, especially since now preparation is underway for its defense, it was carried out before, but today additional events are taking place. I want to tell you...
######## START OF 000084.MP3 (0:38:44 - 0:39:14s) ########
 I want to tell you that if we, reporters, discuss this figure of 60,000 fighters of the enemy, concentrated in the Kherson direction, then our main intelligence department already knows about it, it reported this to the General Staff, the General Staff reported to the Minister and everything else. If we can destroy 20 cities in Ukraine at once, we will have the strength to do it.
######## START OF 000085.MP3 (0:39:12 - 0:39:42s) ########
 Will we have the strength to turn this group into a group of smoke and ashes? Well, maybe, maybe. Alexander, you are provoking provocations. I want to tell you right away, but what about the Kharkov region? Everyone was also shouting, talking, reporters were shouting. And then what happened happened, but we will proceed from the fact that we will not repeat such mistakes again.
######## START OF 000086.MP3 (0:39:40 - 0:40:10s) ########
 We will not repeat such mistakes. Sasha, for God's sake, please, about success. There is good news. After all, something good is happening in Artemovsk now. We almost went in, and they almost went out. Isn't that so? Well, Artemovsk is ... You know what the matter is? We are now striving for a certain stagnation of the front line. It seems to me, as an observer and a former military, to stagnation. Why? Because we expect a surge of forces. We expect a surge of forces.
######## START OF 000087.MP3 (0:40:08 - 0:40:38s) ########
 We expect a surge of forces. We expect that the enemy will run out of forces. If the enemy now goes to attack Kherson, and the hostage, how can he deceive his leader Vladimir Zelensky from such a step, from such an order? Because there, with the well-built defense, we will deliver a very serious blow to the attackers. This is the first. The second. Their forces are melting. We must now reach the peak of our form.
######## START OF 000088.MP3 (0:40:36 - 0:41:06s) ########
 If we compare it with sports terms, at the peak of our capabilities, then we can continue, and the offensive and everything else. But we can't stop now where we are stuck in one place. Artemovsk, and we have already entered there, already private military companies, Wagner, employees, fighters are already fighting in the city itself. We can't stop there, we need to take the baton and turn it into a weapon.
######## START OF 000089.MP3 (0:41:04 - 0:41:34s) ########
 and turn it into a fortress. I hope that they will come there through the efforts of military engineers. Therefore, we are going, we are liberating. Yesterday, Ivangrad, I think that from those convenient positions that the private military companies have taken today, will go further. Well, this is a success. But believe me, we have no reason to be sad in order to pick up the pieces.
######## START OF 000090.MP3 (0:41:32 - 0:42:02s) ########
 We have stabilized the situation. This is the first. The second is that we are waiting for the results of the efforts of the specialists in mobilization readiness and combat training. Evkurov, a young Uzbek, is responsible for combat training. He is very supportive of this. He reacts immediately to the problem.
######## START OF 000091.MP3 (0:42:00 - 0:42:30s) ########
 This problem, that problem, that problem. Governors. Our society has been mobilized... I haven't seen anything like this, to be honest. The first Chechen campaign, when we were gathering a group of the Krupits from all over the country, it was, of course, a difficult situation. The commanders met their units before the battle. People from St. Petersburg came to the dirt of the North Caucasus.
######## START OF 000092.MP3 (0:42:28 - 0:42:58s) ########
 Today we are already making some conclusions, working on mistakes, and more positive than negative. We feel it, reporters. We even look like dogs with smart eyes, but sometimes we can't say anything, but we feel it. I report my feelings to you. Alexander, the enemy is not sleeping either. We have 15,000 more people trained in the UK.
######## START OF 000093.MP3 (0:42:56 - 0:43:26s) ########
 Do you feel it already or not? The enemy is strong, cunning, insidious and determined. We gave an example that we can be driven out of the settlements that we allegedly defend. If we approach this issue properly, then yes, we can.
######## START OF 000094.MP3 (0:43:24 - 0:43:54s) ########
 If you are literate, then yes. You know, I talk to the prisoners, I communicate with them all the time, they bring fresh ones. And I talked to a person who was trained in England, by the way, in the settlement of Oxford, as he said, where the children of rich people are taught. So he told me that when he came back to Zhytomyr, he realized that in Zhytomyr it is better taught.
######## START OF 000095.MP3 (0:43:52 - 0:44:22s) ########
 Ukrainian instructors teach it better. So, as always, American aid in the version of Sochenko's game in the proffesionals. They put two spoons of porridge on you, and for that they take as for four. Money is necessary to write off people. They, of course, are engaged in what ... Can you imagine, the division that we will disassemble in a week of intensive fighting, we need to carry out.
######## START OF 000096.MP3 (0:44:20 - 0:44:50s) ########
 Intensive battles need to be led to England, then bring from Alamansh. That is, these are some wild expenses. I don't know why. There are more demonstrative events. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our wonderful. We should not count, but beat. Alexander Sladkov, our military reporter. Live from Donbass, Donetsk. 33,000 mobilized people are already in the units. Putin voiced
######## START OF 000097.MP3 (0:44:48 - 0:45:18s) ########
 Putin has already announced this figure. 16,000 people are already in the field, performing the tasks set out during the Russian special operations in Ukraine. Putin has also said that new massive strikes on Ukrainian territory are not needed yet. But this is only for now. We are finishing what is happening now. There is no need for massive strikes now.
######## START OF 000098.MP3 (0:45:16 - 0:45:46s) ########
 Now there are other tasks, because of 29 objects, 7 were not hit as planned by the Ministry of Defense, but they are gradually taking these objects. There is no need for massive strikes, but in any case, now, for now. It is interesting that everyone says that the fate of Russia, Ukraine and the future world is now being decided.
######## START OF 000099.MP3 (0:45:44 - 0:46:14s) ########
 The fate of the future world is now decided on the battlefield. And there is such a sermyazhnaya truth in this. Because, well, let's remember, Russia has never been a colony of the West. Well, that's how it happened. No matter how much they tried to conquer us, well, in the 18th year there was a republic in the ring of enemies, and all the territories of present-day Ukraine were under the intervention, and in Arkhangelsk, and in Vladivostok, but nothing worked out. And so...
######## START OF 000100.MP3 (0:46:12 - 0:46:42s) ########
 And so, of course, for the Westerners, to defeat the Russian army is a super-task, it is such an existential thing for them. If we do it, then where will you go, all the rest, the Chinese, who have not won a single war, the Indians, who, as they say, were colonies and have just now finally got their naval flag, where will you go if we can roll out the Russians? We can't, it's all clear, because as we can see, this single front,
######## START OF 000101.MP3 (0:46:40 - 0:47:10s) ########
 As we can see, the united front, which we were depicted as, of 50 countries, which are supplying weapons, which are ready to fight to the last Ukrainian, already turns out to be a friend. And the Ukrainians seem to have not finished, but the money is running out. Here, for example, Elon Musk. It turns out that the cost of SpaceX, well, the straw that broke the back of this camel, is 100 million dollars. Well, it would seem, and the amount is quite serious.
######## START OF 000102.MP3 (0:47:08 - 0:47:38s) ########
 On the other hand, if you take the capitalization, as we were told, look at the capitalization, there is a lot of things. It turned out that there is no such thing. In fact, capitalization is a blow, but in operational expenses, these 100 million are not private. Well, okay, Musk is going to buy Twitter for 44 billion, and we will spit and rub these 100 million. This is the attitude to it. But wait a second, these are the first swallows. I must say that when I read, for example,
######## START OF 000103.MP3 (0:47:36 - 0:48:06s) ########
 I can say that when I read, for example, the article of John Bolton, which says that Putin should leave, and he starts his article with the fact that Putin should leave. What do you mean, Putin should leave? Bolton decided. And we must kill Putin if he starts using nuclear weapons, says Bolton. And then an interesting thought comes to Bolton's mind, that Putin should be created a new opposition, because the old one has run away from Russia.
######## START OF 000104.MP3 (0:48:04 - 0:48:34s) ########
 The old one has run away from Russia. And the question arises, guys, who were these people, whom you have been raising for 20 years, or even 30 years, who, as they say, at the first rumble, began to rush to the upper Lars, somewhere to Kazakhstan, and now you have no agent of influence. And now they will return in two weeks. Well, they will return, but they will return to another country. And what Sasha Sladkov says, that he has not seen such unity. I feel it too.
######## START OF 000105.MP3 (0:48:32 - 0:49:02s) ########
 I also feel it in my own life, in my acquaintances. That is, the civil society that the Westerners have always tried to grow there, it has grown by itself. Moreover, it is the one that supports its army, supports its country, which volunteers and volunteers do no less than the Ministry of Defense. I don't want to say anything about the Ministry of Defense, but what we see now from ordinary people… I don't want to say anything. On the contrary, everything is clear.
######## START OF 000106.MP3 (0:49:00 - 0:49:30s) ########
 I don't want to say anything. On the contrary, everything is correct. They point out mistakes without hesitation, without looking back at the authorities. And society does it right. This position that the bosses are more visible, it is now more and more leaving. The bosses often do not see what is happening in places. And those people who talk about it, the same military corps that were constantly tried to say, well, why are you still not outlawed under the Ministry of Defense? They have chosen a common position. And there is no common position, because everywhere the front is different.
######## START OF 000107.MP3 (0:49:28 - 0:49:58s) ########
 Because everywhere the front is different. Somewhere everything is great, and somewhere, excuse me, everything is not so great. We clearly saw this in the Kharkov region, when a catastrophe occurred at the front, and it turned out that the defeat has no fathers, but orphans. And then the investigations on the personnel began, which continue. And here the issue of civil society is very important, because if we are together with our homeland, with our state, with our army, we will win. And what remains in this country?
######## START OF 000108.MP3 (0:49:56 - 0:50:26s) ########
 And what is left in this case only for the West? To try to deprive us of any allies, any possible ones. We are constantly discussing how our diplomacy works, how our ties with other countries work, how much they are our allies. And here is a very interesting question. I am now looking at how the West is already starting to swim a position. Look at this proposed ceiling on oil. What is it, in fact? The West is already starting to swim a position.
######## START OF 000109.MP3 (0:50:24 - 0:50:54s) ########
 Western countries don't buy oil anyway. They introduced embargo. This is an offer to other countries. They buy, but they don't buy officially. This is an offer to other countries. Please, declare that you will also impose such easy sanctions on the Russian Federation. Not 40 dollars, not 50, at least 60. Another question is that we ourselves sell 75 with some discount. What would you say to this?
######## START OF 000110.MP3 (0:50:52 - 0:51:22s) ########
 with some discount. But it should not be a good will of Russia, but an obligation. And it is very important that now the West is actually walking through those countries that have not joined and offers at least something, so that they formally take the same position of condemnation of the Russian Federation. But so far, judging by everything, as we see from the constant meetings, and the last one that was in Kazakhstan, nothing is working out. Of an optimistic attitude.
######## START OF 000111.MP3 (0:51:20 - 0:51:50s) ########
 I'm optimistic, but let's say. Not everyone has this attitude. I'm glad that everyone is immersed in the economy, it's very cool, very fun, and let's all work in different directions. Of course, there are different attitudes to different situations in the Russian Federation, and what is happening with mobilization in Moscow and St. Petersburg, there are also mistakes, and we must point out them. With all due respect to civil society, which has come together, there are too many problems. And civil society is also specific.
######## START OF 000112.MP3 (0:51:48 - 0:52:18s) ########
 The civil society is also specific. The fact that this happened in partial mobilization is also a mistake that happened in the summer. No one talked about this partial mobilization in the summer. I remind you. By the way, she also has her fathers. I would not want them to leave their element. Probably, Lars is also a civil society. There are also different people there. Putin said that I treat each of them ... You just got together, not all as you just declared. The civil society is much more than that.
######## START OF 000113.MP3 (0:52:16 - 0:52:46s) ########
 Civil society is much more than just a group. We are all very different, our infinite difference is our strength in many ways. The question is that we should have a position, and we should not, according to the principle of no time to explain, we will do everything ourselves. This is not how it works. Civil society is a responsibility, first of all. And it should work at all levels, by the way. And everyone should have this responsibility. In short, the point is that everyone should do everything, but we should not interfere with our opponents, if we are so to say immersed in serious things, on our own.
######## START OF 000114.MP3 (0:52:44 - 0:53:14s) ########
 We are dealing with serious things. They are destroying their own economies. They don't need help. They can manage without us. But we are trying to help them. We are trying to help them. Military people, you can go there. International people, you can go there. Flags in your hands, regions, great. Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to correct their mistakes with the pound. It dropped it even more. They didn't need help. They didn't need to go there and say, «They are trying to take my flags».
######## START OF 000115.MP3 (0:53:12 - 0:53:42s) ########
 I've said it three times, but they're trying to beat me up. It's the year of the four treasuries. I'm glad, but it was a joke from the very beginning, in the summer. Because someone is tracking these treasuries. Let's tell our viewers that today the UK resigned, the Minister of Finance wrote a scandalous letter. The fourth in a year. The other thing is that it has already been. There is already a rotation. The point is that the situation should have been stabilized, but the pound is even higher.
######## START OF 000116.MP3 (0:53:40 - 0:54:10s) ########
 It was a stabilizing situation, and the pound fell even more. It fell today only on this. We were all thinking that it would fall on Friday, that it would be the first hit. Next time, I remind you, on October 31, we immediately put checkmarks there. Because our opponents were falling? And because, accordingly, the economy is in the legs again. So, accordingly, something is still going on. And it is going on in different directions, by the way. And there, because people think, because they sit, accordingly, plan something, by the way, and know what will happen on what date. So, by the way, we also wanted such a certainty in a number of directions. That's what we wanted.
######## START OF 000117.MP3 (0:54:08 - 0:54:38s) ########
 So, what about the component? Do you like the economic department or the military department? We have already addressed this question a long time ago. The question is not about this. The military department is also an economic department, because we send money there, by the way. It is important that you can always calculate the effectiveness. The account is always on the table, you can always look at it. You have a result, for example, from the economic component, you have a specific amount of GDP that you received, you have a specific amount of export and import, you can understand it. And you have a decision of the security services, you can calculate it.
######## START OF 000118.MP3 (0:54:36 - 0:55:06s) ########
 You can calculate how much is reduced, what to do. There is a result with which you can work. As for the military component, why do we have such good relations with India? Because we have been building relations with him for a long time, with Vietnam. And on this background, we created an economic component. The same goes for all other directions, the same goes for the Chinese direction. Therefore, this is a comprehensive approach, but it works somewhere. As for the European Union, the very beginning says that the UK will suffer the most from this. And from the very beginning it was clear why the UK would be involved in this.
######## START OF 000119.MP3 (0:55:04 - 0:55:34s) ########
 It was clear why the UK would be involved in this, because Brexit hit it. There were no other options. The UK was still hit hard this year, and it had to find an alternative. Their alternative is Ukraine. It is their Iraq, their Afghanistan. It was clear that the economic situation would be complicated, and it would be necessary to get out of some external political situation.
######## START OF 000120.MP3 (0:55:32 - 0:56:02s) ########
 First, we need to understand what is happening to them in order to understand what will happen. Why? Accordingly, Biden has an election in November, so they will force and try to drive everything to Kherson. By November, they need the result by that time. And at the time when the first offensive to Kherson was, the first offensive to Kherson, as we all remember, did not end very well. And there were the biggest losses, of course, in the steppe and so on. Therefore, from this point of view, it is necessary to understand what mechanisms are pushing there and, accordingly, how it will be in time.
