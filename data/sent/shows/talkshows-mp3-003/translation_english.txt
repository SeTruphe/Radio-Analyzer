 Great. So, how are we going to work today? I've prepared a digest of the main events that have been unfolding in the last week and that are unfolding today. Certain things are still developing, I can see them. We'll talk about it, exchange opinions on some of them. We'll talk about something in more detail. Naturally, the news will be...
######## START OF 000014.MP3 (0:06:04 - 0:06:34s) ########
 news as it is said today, this is already in accordance with the news yesterday, I mean the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg, the investigative committee reported that it means that Darya Trepova was detained, this is the very Darya Trepova and the last news, the last news, she actually tells that, but she was aware of the general one word that she works for some comrades from Ukraine
######## START OF 000015.MP3 (0:06:32 - 0:07:02s) ########
 comrade from Ukraine and that she was lucky this sculpture is a statuette bust in general it is not clear what and she knew that this whole story with the filling she tells about what was told to her by the curator and for a second imagine yes terminology here is a girl who actually uses such words that the curator said that inside and this
######## START OF 000016.MP3 (0:07:00 - 0:07:30s) ########
 said that inside this thing earpiece that it is necessary to be sure to hand over means Vladlenu Tatarsky in order for them to have the opportunity to listen to him in order to then recruit him, that is, she was aware of these plans and therefore all conversations and all messages that were yesterday and at night and this morning that it could be used
######## START OF 000017.MP3 (0:07:28 - 0:07:58s) ########
 that it could be used in the dark that she did not know anything all of them turned out to be incompetent, I actually well, I'll just tell you how to say yes, I talked there with friends and when the message went that it could be used in the dark that she, along with her husband, participated in some anti-military rallies in St. Petersburg in the area of the guest house that they were detained there that she was there for something there for 10 days
######## START OF 000018.MP3 (0:07:56 - 0:08:26s) ########
 that she was sentenced to 10 days in prison, that it all has nothing to do with Ukraine, and that it's a matter of the hands of the Russian radical opposition. I didn't believe it at first. I argued with my friends yesterday, I said I didn't believe it, because what I see says that it was a well-prepared story. It's obvious why.
######## START OF 000019.MP3 (0:08:24 - 0:08:54s) ########
 It is obvious why it was needed, what goals were pursued. I said that it was unlikely that the SBU did it. I don't know if there is such an operation in the SBU's service list. But the fact that it could be done by Ukrainian military intelligence, we have GRU, and they have GUR, the main intelligence department in Ukraine, but it is likely that it is.
######## START OF 000020.MP3 (0:08:52 - 0:09:22s) ########
 it is and that they are they we will find out about it well, it took only a few hours and exactly to this conclusion comes the investigation itself what happened there, that is, she brought this story brought this statuette entered the room transmits still joked there you remember me yes I remember you this is something there wrote a postcard there something else yes I remember here you are this is bust
######## START OF 000021.MP3 (0:09:20 - 0:09:50s) ########
 And this bust, he also watched, joked, and that's it. And then an unexpected story happened. He offered her to sit down. After all, it usually happens like this, if she brings something, yes, and knows that it's a bomb. Well, of course, she had to panic at that moment. Because usually it happened like this. Well, let's remember those very years when we went through it. We have already experienced all these terrorist attacks.
######## START OF 000022.MP3 (0:09:48 - 0:10:18s) ########
 all these terrorist attacks were already experienced, especially in Moscow, I will not even list them, you remember all this perfectly. Shahids, you remember, they were tied with explosive belts, and then a signal was sent from the station, they took off, that is, such live bombs, with which not a single special service in the world can cope. Here, here, they tell her to sit down, she slept there, I was shy, I did not want to disturb her.
######## START OF 000023.MP3 (0:10:16 - 0:10:46s) ########
 She started to say, I'm shy, I'm... But she sat down and was inside for a while. What does it mean? I'm telling you what I told my friends. It means that she didn't know that there was a bomb. Because, let's suppose, that the curators, those who were leading her, could have told her, we'll warn you, don't be afraid,
######## START OF 000024.MP3 (0:10:44 - 0:11:14s) ########
 You need to bring it, leave it somewhere under the oak table, or hand it over, or something else. But we'll warn you, when you get a text or a message, you'll have to leave quickly, because the clockwork will be working. There is an option, but it's not such an idiot who could actually believe it. She could, but she'll doubt it. In any case, she should be nervous.
######## START OF 000025.MP3 (0:11:12 - 0:11:42s) ########
 It should be nervous. And it didn't look like a nervous person. It means that it possessed some information, but it wasn't connected with the bomb. And here you go, you see, it's been several hours and it turned out like this. They told her, the eavesdropper, that we'll just listen to it to recruit. It's an amazing story, of course, to recruit and so on.
######## START OF 000026.MP3 (0:11:40 - 0:12:10s) ########
 They were telling the story all night long that they won't find her, that she's already crossing the Estonian border, hinting at the previous terrorist attack, when Darya Dugina was killed and this woman who got settled in Russia managed to leave. They were driving them away, I won't even mention the names of these bloggers, millionaires, who always claim to be the best.
######## START OF 000027.MP3 (0:12:08 - 0:12:38s) ########
 who always claim the truth in the last instance, I immediately said that they would find an option, no, they will definitely find it, this is Petersburg, this is a camera, they will definitely find it, and they found it, although the information, of course, came , you know, throughout the whole night, contradictory information came, and it was accompanied by video footage, a woman is walking there, he is sitting there, they lower her there on the stairs, she goes down, they put her in the car there, they take her away, then they take her out
######## START OF 000028.MP3 (0:12:36 - 0:13:06s) ########
 and then it turns out that this is a mother, that this is a sister. I didn't understand this at all, and no one has explained it to us yet. They say she rented an apartment and that she came to St. Petersburg. I am guided by the information that is in the telegram channels. She came from somewhere in St. Petersburg, rented an apartment and so on. Okay, if she rented an apartment where she lived with her husband, what does her mother and sister do there? Or is she from St. Petersburg herself? I want to know the specifics.
######## START OF 000029.MP3 (0:13:04 - 0:13:34s) ########
 I have a lot of information about this particular channel. Every Telegram channel is referring to the source in the Investigative Committee or the FSB. But I still have questions. I was sure that they would find it. In Moscow, it would be much faster. In St. Petersburg, it would take a little longer. But they found it. That's what I think.
######## START OF 000030.MP3 (0:13:32 - 0:14:02s) ########
 I saw similar things that you sent me, Oleg. It says that birthplace is another place. It doesn't matter. Does she look like a person who regrets what she did? No, she is a young girl.
######## START OF 000031.MP3 (0:14:00 - 0:14:30s) ########
 But she, you know, she's pretty confident, confident, actually, she feels... Well, you can't see that she's scared. In the video, the hair is long, and they took her with a haircut. What does it mean? It means that she understands that they will be looking for her now, and she quickly got herself a haircut to get away.
######## START OF 000032.MP3 (0:14:28 - 0:14:58s) ########
 to jump off, yes, there was information that she had to fly to Uzbekistan, but this is St. Petersburg and therefore it was not possible to leave quickly, it was not possible to leave quickly, especially after what happened to Dugin, that is, the special services worked out this time clearly, they traced took you can say as much as you want there it is said here how these bloggers, or rather how this particular blogger there
######## START OF 000033.MP3 (0:14:56 - 0:15:26s) ########
 like this particular blogger there with Styob to tell about what I am FSB they in such an unexpected place and found there in the same apartment that she rented with her husband they came there she is there you can of course there is someone with Styob about this to say but here they worked clearly guys and they took it I think that she will tell a lot of interesting things I don't know I'm not sure that they will tell us about everything about this but she will tell a lot of interesting things about the fact that she has been cooperating for a long time
######## START OF 000034.MP3 (0:15:24 - 0:15:54s) ########
 She has been working with people who are probably staff members of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine for a long time. There were publications that her friends told her that she found some work. This work was related to delivering some parcels. It seems that some Ukrainian journalists offered her this work. She is so stupid that she doesn't understand who she is working for.
######## START OF 000035.MP3 (0:15:52 - 0:16:22s) ########
 I think she understood perfectly well who she was working for. I think she sympathized with them, she is 100% on their side. Because every participant of any anti-military rally is exactly a sympathizer of Ukraine. These are the people who may not be shouting out loud in our squares these Bandera slogans, but they are exactly the same. I have no doubts here, just in principle.
######## START OF 000036.MP3 (0:16:20 - 0:16:50s) ########
 She knew what she was doing, she probably received money for it, maybe good or not, it doesn't matter, she received money for it. What's next? What did I pay attention to? And the publication of this blogger I was talking about, and publications in the Ukrainian segment of Telegram, or in general, in the Ukrainian Internet.
######## START OF 000037.MP3 (0:16:48 - 0:17:18s) ########
 on the Ukrainian Internet. Well, apart from all this nasty behavior, which we are already used to, they have become completely nasty. They always make a dance with drums when there is any tragedy in Russia. We will not talk about it. Everything is clear here. What did they say there? They began to say that this is, of course, Russian internet.
######## START OF 000038.MP3 (0:17:16 - 0:17:46s) ########
 This is, of course, Russian internal strife. This is Russian internal strife, this is all done by the Russian opposition, this is either people from the FBK, or people from this Libertarian Party. I think if we go out to the subway and stop everyone, well, we will stop people and ask them about this Libertarian Party, I think that no one has heard anything about it. At best, I don't know, out of a thousand, if only one person heard anything.
######## START OF 000039.MP3 (0:17:44 - 0:18:14s) ########
 I don't know if you've heard anything from 1000 or 1, about some freaks who tell us that they are members of this party. It's better to be honest. But in Ukraine they started to spread this story. And they did it consciously. And these telegram channels that leak information from the office of the President of Ukraine, they wrote that they were just spreading their methods, their networks, so that exactly the same thing would be done by the Ukrainian people.
######## START OF 000040.MP3 (0:18:12 - 0:18:42s) ########
 to make an emphasis on this. Why? Why? We see it not for the first time. We see it at least for the second time. Remember this story with Bryansk region. What did they tell us? That Ukraine is not involved at all. It has nothing to do with it. Can the Ukrainian state do such things? No, we are not alone.
######## START OF 000041.MP3 (0:18:40 - 0:19:10s) ########
 No, no, no, we are not one Ukrainian structure, could not stand behind this raid, it was all done by the Russian opposition. These are the Vlasovets, what's their battalion, what are they there, Legion, what it is called, well, it doesn't matter. It's them, it's all, it's all Putin's opponents, it's those who hate him and that's how they can actually fight with him now. And so Ukraine has nothing to do with it, it's all your internal disassembly.
######## START OF 000042.MP3 (0:19:08 - 0:19:38s) ########
 And they started to publish the same things now. Ukraine has nothing to do with it. It's all internal disassembly. It's some freaks from the Libertarian Party. Or maybe it's some people who use sleeping cells of the FBK, these morons. It's all done by them, and Ukraine has nothing to do with it. And the more I saw these publications, the clearer the picture became.
######## START OF 000043.MP3 (0:19:36 - 0:20:06s) ########
 This picture becomes extremely clear. It is a well-planned operation of the main intelligence department of Ukraine. Why did they try to move the focus? Why are they distancing? Because it is a terrorist attack. Even those who are being helped today, those who provide them with assistance for 65 years,
######## START OF 000044.MP3 (0:20:04 - 0:20:34s) ########
 Even if they get 65 billion dollars, they don't like terrorist attacks. Because no one likes terrorist attacks. It's obvious. Do you remember the reaction in the USA after Bryansk?
######## START OF 000045.MP3 (0:20:32 - 0:21:02s) ########
 We condemn, we don't support such actions, and if Kiev did it, we don't like it. Not because they love us, but because they haven't reached the point where they can justify terrorist attacks only because they are against Russia. They haven't reached that point yet.
######## START OF 000046.MP3 (0:21:00 - 0:21:30s) ########
 They haven't reached Russia yet. They are one step away from it, but they haven't reached it yet. Do you know what this movement is about? They had already reached this point once, when they justified any terrorist, any actions of outright terrorists, because it was beneficial for them. And it was against Russia. Although, back then, they said, no, Russia is good, we are friends.
######## START OF 000047.MP3 (0:21:28 - 0:21:58s) ########
 We are friends. Now, not today, tomorrow we will accept a visa-free regime. I'm talking about the Chechen wars. When there were wars in Chechnya, they all called the terrorists rebels. In all the Western newspapers. They didn't use the word terrorist. They called them, people stole planes.
######## START OF 000048.MP3 (0:21:56 - 0:22:26s) ########
 They were hijacking planes, and it turned out to be the fighters for freedom. People were hijacking schools, hospitals, Nordost, and so on. And they call them all insurgents, the fighters for independence. It was just amazing. We reacted to it in a sluggish way. Not even sluggish, at that moment our country was some kind of strange object. We didn't know what to do.
######## START OF 000049.MP3 (0:22:24 - 0:22:54s) ########
 strange such object, that is, we only only here we stood on our feet, only began to grow, that is, we were still small children we did not understand very many nuances, we even our own army that put order in the North Caucasus, we called the Russian army on the air of federal channels and in the reports we ourselves said the Russian army there somewhere in the area
######## START OF 000050.MP3 (0:22:52 - 0:23:22s) ########
 somewhere in the area of ​​Achkhoi-Martan, there did something, something there, but the Chechens did something, something there, you know, yes, that is, terminology, it would seem, is a trifle, but it is with the meaning of this whole terminology and formulation. And when you talk about a counterterrorist operation, which is carried out on the territory of your own country, but at the same time you call your army Russian, you imply somewhere there this is an interlinear term.
######## START OF 000051.MP3 (0:23:20 - 0:23:50s) ########
 Somewhere there, somewhere in between lines it is read that the territory of Chechnya, where all this happens, is not the territory of Russia. That is, there is a Russian army that is somewhere acting. And only, only, already at the end of the first Chechen war, I remember it perfectly, suddenly it dawned, suddenly it dawned that it was necessary to call the army not a Russian, but a federal group. Federal group.
######## START OF 000052.MP3 (0:23:48 - 0:24:18s) ########
 Federal group, that is, the army that acts on its own territory and all. And they, they are the world champions in this. They have long passed this path with all these formulations and terminologies. And they called them the rebels and the fighters for independence. Do you understand, yes? Here...
######## START OF 000053.MP3 (0:24:16 - 0:24:46s) ########
 What was the purpose of the persecution? The purpose was to scare us. And it worked. I'm coming back to the conversation with my friends. Many of them were tense. Many of them were tense because it was St. Petersburg, it was the University embankment. The University embankment. Evgeny Vorkunov knows where it is.
######## START OF 000054.MP3 (0:24:44 - 0:25:14s) ########
 Evgeny Vorkunov knows where the embankment is. It's two steps away from everything. Two steps away from the Winter Palace, two steps away from the Kuntskamera, half a step away from the University. It's the closest thing to St. Petersburg. And it turns out that the main intelligence department of Ukraine is conducting an operation in the center of St. Petersburg. Many people are tense.
######## START OF 000055.MP3 (0:25:12 - 0:25:42s) ########
 And they say that it's a ritual murder, to scare all the other leaders of public opinion, so that they mean that they can reach each of them. It worked somewhere, it didn't, but the goal of any terrorist act is to intimidate.
######## START OF 000056.MP3 (0:25:40 - 0:26:10s) ########
 The fact is that the threat is obvious. I don't know how our leadership will react, because after what happened to Darya Dugina, strikes were made, including on Kiev. It is quite obvious that we are dealing with a terrorist state. If we are talking about...
######## START OF 000057.MP3 (0:26:08 - 0:26:38s) ########
 If we talk about the terrorist acts that we have already seen, there was the Crimean bridge, it was a terrorist act. They used people in the dark, they took them there, and at some point they blew it up. Dugin's terrorist act, terrorist act. But they are always trying to shift attention, remove, translate into something. And here I...
######## START OF 000058.MP3 (0:26:36 - 0:27:06s) ########
 And here, when I saw the statement of Prigozhin at 11 p.m. that it doesn't look like the actions of Kiev authorities, and that it's probably some... I have this synchronization, we'll show it. I was very surprised, I didn't understand why, on what basis such statements. Such statements are...
######## START OF 000059.MP3 (0:27:04 - 0:27:34s) ########
 Such statements simply cannot be made. It is unlikely that Prigozhin already had some information, because it all unfolded at once. He had no additional information, plus he was directly in Artemovsk. Why suddenly such statements? It is very interesting. I think that Wagner's manager should probably be broadcasted on any telegram channel.
######## START OF 000060.MP3 (0:27:32 - 0:28:02s) ########
 Now, in any telegram channel, in my channel or in some other, and explain this position, because, of course, not on purpose, but at that moment he just took and played along with this defrosting, which is just now, in this very second, and spread the methods on all their networks in order to exactly these very theses and spread. And then suddenly, once and coincided. I'll show you the synchro of Prigozhin, but already after the news, he's already in the video.
######## START OF 000061.MP3 (0:28:00 - 0:28:30s) ########
 We'll continue in a few minutes. Attention, attention! This is Moscow! 94.8 Moscow, 18.30, Philip Klymenov's studio, hello. The number of people who were injured in the explosion in St. Petersburg increased to 33, of which 2 were women.

 The number of victims has increased to 33. Among them, two teenagers. This was told in the press service of the Ministry of Health of Russia. The explosion in a cafe on University Street in St. Petersburg happened the night before. The military correspondent Vladlen Tatarskiy died. The explosive device was in the statuette that was given to him. Daria Trepova brought a bomb to St. Petersburg in a car. The girl thought that inside the bust was not an explosive, but a listening device. She was given a task to get closer to Tatarskiy.

Previously, the Investigative Committee re-qualified the case of the explosion in a cafe in St. Petersburg for a terrorist attack.

Earlier, the head of the federal project for security and fight against corruption Vitaly Borodin said that he had addressed the heads of Voronezh, Rostov-on-Don and Krasnodar with a request to cancel the concert of the Ukrainian artist. He argued that Anya Lorak was going to cancel the concert.

 This was argued by the fact that Ania Lorak was collecting money for Ukrainian citizens in social networks. FK Chemka announced the resignation of Spartak Gogniev from the position of head coach. The agreement with the specialist was broken by mutual consent of the parties. As reported by the task general director of the club, Nikolai Olenev, the responsibility of the head coach of the team will be performed by Inat Beledinov. The day before, the Moscow Chemka lost to Krasnodar with a score of 0-6. The team takes the penultimate 15th place in the Russian football championship.

Why go to Uzbekistan if there is a listening device? Ivan Kuznetsov asks. Of course. Why go to Uzbekistan if there is a listening device? Let's go on. She will be brave for a few hours until she realizes that she is being waited for.
######## START OF 000076.MP3 (0:35:00 - 0:35:30s) ########
 She'll understand that she's waiting for her. Kvara Tsetkin, damn it, writes to us. Dmitry. Well, listen, I don't know if she'll be brave for a couple of hours or not, but she seems to me... I'm already talking about it. She's so calm, without panic, telling some details, you see, they appear. Apparently, her departure was not planned. If she had a ticket to Uzbekistan in advance, then we can say that she's ready.
######## START OF 000077.MP3 (0:35:28 - 0:35:58s) ########
 the ticket to Uzbekistan, it can be argued that she knew about the bomb from the hearing, she would not run, why do I say that she could not know about the bomb because she when they said let's find a place in the hall and preferably closer to me and type sit here with us she did not say no no I need to run away I just ran in for a second there to you this head gold there to convey no she sat down I think that I think that here are two options, yes, or she was given there
######## START OF 000078.MP3 (0:35:56 - 0:36:26s) ########
 Or she was given some honest pioneer advice that they would give her time to leave, and she was such a naive idiot who believed it. Or she really thought that there was a hearing device. Then, when all this happened, she decided, as they say, that she needed to change her hairstyle and go somewhere. Grigory from St. Petersburg told us that he arrived from Kaliningrad in the evening. He was already in St. Petersburg late in the evening.
######## START OF 000079.MP3 (0:36:24 - 0:36:54s) ########
 Late at night, he was already in St. Petersburg, and the intensification was not noticeable. She was told to give a dry-clean, rub in trust, if I understood correctly, why then, after the transfer of the statuette, she left the event in a few minutes. If she gave it right away, then she could have... Well, that's what we were talking about. That's exactly what you're talking about. You're also talking about this topic. Of course, I wish her a fair sentence and punishment, but she won't tell me anything.
######## START OF 000080.MP3 (0:36:52 - 0:37:22s) ########
 I'm sure that she will say something to Kazanin that she won't live to see the court, she's not interested in this. She writes a good doc. I don't know about this. Here's a question that we asked each other, I think, two million times during these days. Why didn't we prevent this whole story? But, guys, there are no magicians, there is no perfect world. There are people everywhere, and they work.
######## START OF 000081.MP3 (0:37:20 - 0:37:50s) ########
 These people work and then we find out how many terrorist attacks they prevent. Do you forget about it? Prevent everything? Well, I think it's just impossible. Just impossible. And to introduce someone, for example, there, to the main intelligence department or to the SBU, and from there, in fact, to receive some information and to convey it, I'm sure that we have these people there. But one Stirlitz is enough for us in all cases of life.
######## START OF 000082.MP3 (0:37:48 - 0:38:18s) ########
 We have enough of Stirlitz in all cases of life. That is, one Stirlitz who worked in the Imperial Security Department, he had to know absolutely everything. Yes, this is enough. It seems to me that this is not enough. And therefore, such options are possible. This is not the point. The point is different. The point is that now we must clearly understand that this is possible. This is possible in St. Petersburg, this is possible in Moscow, this is possible in any Russian city. Starting from Kaliningrad...
######## START OF 000083.MP3 (0:38:16 - 0:38:46s) ########
 in Russia, from Kaliningrad to Vladivostok. We should understand this and do something. I'm not talking about missile attacks on Ukrainian territory. I'm not talking about that. It's something else. Evgeny Vorkunov asks, we didn't understand that. You won't believe, Evgeny, we still have a lot of people,
######## START OF 000084.MP3 (0:38:44 - 0:39:14s) ########
 There are still a lot of people who simply don't understand what we are dealing with in Ukraine and who we are dealing with. They don't understand. These are people who are discussing the categories of not only yesterday, but the day before yesterday. And they perceive this bandit state, which has been absolutely hostile to us since the first day of its existence, as the Ukrainian SS. The resident of the Soviet Union, where girls with wreaths and this fountain on the VDN.
######## START OF 000085.MP3 (0:39:12 - 0:39:42s) ########
 and this fountain of DNA. This is how they perceive it. I have already said this many times. This is an amazing story. And what else should happen so that these people finally understand who we are dealing with? But we have... And you say that before they didn't understand? They still don't understand. And I can still ask what else should they do so that you understand who we are dealing with? To be continued...
######## START OF 000086.MP3 (0:39:40 - 0:40:10s) ########
 But I'm talking about something else. What should we do? Each of us. Tell me, please, how long ago did any of you see that someone was in danger of being taken to some forgotten stash in a subway car, tram or trolleybus? I don't remember.
######## START OF 000087.MP3 (0:40:08 - 0:40:38s) ########
 I don't remember anything, I don't even see it in the news. And I remember there was a time, I remember there was a time when we didn't even come close to those things, to those packages that someone forgot somewhere. I remember when our houses in Moscow were blown up, do you remember that? When the house was blown up at Kashirka, I came there.
######## START OF 000088.MP3 (0:40:36 - 0:41:06s) ########
 I came there, and before even came there firemen, emergency services, and I just will never forget it for life, as they say, I remembered, still rain, like now, that was the weather, in the air this white dust, construction, I was on duty in the editorial office, I had such a blue wedding jacket, I was, so immediately I pulled out the jacket,
######## START OF 000089.MP3 (0:41:04 - 0:41:34s) ########
 As soon as I was there, I immediately went to the place of the terrorist attack. The jacket became snow-white, like this table. And this is an endless number of bodies that began to be pulled out from under the rubble of the rescuers. And they brought these people who died to the box that was in the yard. And there, it means, all this thing was put together like this, all these bodies. What happened next?
######## START OF 000090.MP3 (0:41:32 - 0:42:02s) ########
 What happened next? Well, then we took some action. Printed all the basements and attics. Do you remember all this? Printed. District officers walked around the apartments, found out who lives, checked these people, each in his own area. By the way, the explosion at Kashirka, I also remember for the rest of my life. There was a nearby building, the dormitory of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
######## START OF 000091.MP3 (0:42:00 - 0:42:30s) ########
 And the district police officer, who was also in the basement, in the basement of the police station, was a senior lieutenant Kuzovoy, his last name was. He was supposed to go around all the residents, to remind them of the danger, so that people would not lose their vigilance, and so on. I even walked around the apartments where the police officers lived, this dormitory, and no one saw him, this old man. He was later fired from the department.
######## START OF 000092.MP3 (0:42:28 - 0:42:58s) ########
 He was later fired from the Ministry of Internal Affairs. I don't know what happened to him later, maybe he was restored, but at that moment he was fired. But it was a whole company, it was a company in the media, it was a company in society. People went to the troops, joined forces and went, watched what was happening in their yards. The men themselves, after these explosions, began to patrol.
######## START OF 000093.MP3 (0:42:56 - 0:43:26s) ########
 As they say, by patrolling. But we don't have all this. The country is conducting military operations. And it's as if it's all on another planet. Everything is on another planet. Hence the answers to the question. And about the framework. And about all this stuff. You brought the bomb. You will leave it here. And then she left it. But then they just took it and gave it away. No framework, no peace.
######## START OF 000094.MP3 (0:43:24 - 0:43:54s) ########
 No safety measures, no borders, nothing. Maybe it's time to do something about it? Maybe we should reduce the probability of such terrorist acts? Maybe it's time? If you don't enter the station building, let's say, at the airport, until you show your luggage, why?
######## START OF 000095.MP3 (0:43:52 - 0:44:22s) ########
 Why? Why? Because before you just went to the building of the air station and that's it. And you were already shown the luggage only at the moment when you handed it over for registration. Stood at the registration and handed over this luggage. There it was actually highlighted. And now? And when you come in, they highlight. And then you go through so-called, remember, with these boarding passes, you go there, and the security officers stamp you, do it.
######## START OF 000096.MP3 (0:44:20 - 0:44:50s) ########
 And you find yourself at the tape, and there are also jackets and belts and shoes there, you are also taken off, also shown. It all happened after what? It all happened after there were explosions at the airport. Remember the explosion in Domodedovo? There were hijacks of planes. It was done then. And then in our country a huge number of people were outraged and said, what is this? This is a violation of human rights. I am being exposed in this video.
######## START OF 000097.MP3 (0:44:48 - 0:45:18s) ########
 I'm being exposed in this device where you stand like this, you know, once you scrolled there, you raise your hands, yes, I'm exposed, and naked I'm seen there, this x-ray image, but nevertheless, this nonsense we continued to carry all these defenders, I don't know how to call it, now we are used to it, because we understand what is happening, let's go back a little now,
######## START OF 000098.MP3 (0:45:16 - 0:45:46s) ########
 Now let's go back a little bit to that state and understand what is happening. What is happening? If then, I don't know, just patrols, police could stop near some person or group of people and check the documents, because these people were different from the population, right? Do you remember this whole story? The faces of the Caucasian nationality and so on. Now, many times more.
######## START OF 000099.MP3 (0:45:44 - 0:46:14s) ########
 Now it's getting worse. You will never tell a person who is walking with an explosive device from a person who lives in the same building. And if we ourselves do not show vigilance, for example, in the case of life, a car with Ukrainian license plates appeared in the yard. And I didn't like it. I have 28 thousand in my head.
######## START OF 000100.MP3 (0:46:12 - 0:46:42s) ########
 I have 28,000 different options in my head, how do I know who it is? I can't figure out who this person is, who suddenly appeared in his car in the yard, which means that he may have rented an apartment here. And who is this person? Do we know anything about him? Or maybe he brought three bags of hexogen on this car and will do what he does? But there is such an option. Do these thoughts come to mind? Of course, these thoughts come to mind. Who should do it?
######## START OF 000101.MP3 (0:46:40 - 0:47:10s) ########
 Who should do this? Check who this person is, what he does here, where he lives, when he arrived, what he breathes in general. Accordingly, the Ministry of Internal Affairs should call there and make them do it. Let's turn on this mode, finally. Maybe it's enough to deal with this nonsense that we are doing. I've already said it many times. Look how many cars with Ukrainian license plates.
######## START OF 000102.MP3 (0:47:08 - 0:47:38s) ########
 Who are these people who came here? Maybe they are good people who escaped from the war? Yes, maybe. But let's be more attentive to these people. Who can you not take? They come here, rent some apartments, in the immediate vicinity of the object that is to be destroyed, liquidated, observe, do something, put some explosive devices, and it will continue to infinity.
######## START OF 000103.MP3 (0:47:36 - 0:48:06s) ########
 And then, without doing anything, we say, where are our special services looking? The same ordinary people work in the special services. And they are not magicians with a blue helicopter, who will fly there and give everyone an eskimo, as they say, and show a movie for free. They are exactly the same people as we are. They do what they can. They try to work ahead of schedule, but 100% of the results are possible. And it doesn't matter whether she is Ukrainian or not.
######## START OF 000104.MP3 (0:48:04 - 0:48:34s) ########
 It doesn't matter if she is Ukrainian or not. I'm talking about the world complex. And what does Ukrainian mean? You are in Ukraine, you are focused on the surname. You are not focused on the surname. There are a lot of people in Ukraine whose surname is even more Russian than yours. But they think they are the most Ukrainian. So what? The world complex should be there. If they rent an apartment near you, find out who these people are.
######## START OF 000105.MP3 (0:48:32 - 0:49:02s) ########
 Find out who these people are. But we are not interested. We don't need it. We have no time. And then it's too late. Call somewhere. Let them come and check the documents. Find out who this person is. Let them take him under surveillance. Demand from the district police that they turn into real characters, not virtual ones. I don't know. But we have to do something ourselves.
######## START OF 000106.MP3 (0:49:00 - 0:49:30s) ########
 We need to do something ourselves. It's time. Because terrorist attacks are already taking place in the capital cities. And it's possible in all other cities. Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know. But let's exchange opinions. Let's go. Good evening. I'm listening to you on air. Good evening, Roman. Hello. Listen, your phrase, call somewhere. You should be given a phone, first of all. If not, you let the situation go.
######## START OF 000107.MP3 (0:49:28 - 0:49:58s) ########
 And they let the situation go. They really did. But you, as a deputy of the Moscow City Duma, you see what you're doing on the street. Call the police. Do you know the police phone number? Of course. But call there. If you see something suspicious or something wrong, call there. Listen, I have my own police officer. He was there. He will go in a short time. Now I don't know. I don't know.
######## START OF 000108.MP3 (0:49:56 - 0:50:26s) ########
 I don't know, I've been living in a house for 50 years. Yes. I saw him regularly until 1989. Then, only the last names change. There was such a thing, no one came to visit. We have a normal number of rented apartments in the house. Now, no one is following this. Then, look, these taxi drivers, it's not clear at all who is there.
######## START OF 000109.MP3 (0:50:24 - 0:50:54s) ########
 It's a clear story, who's there, yes, maybe Ukrainians, yes, maybe they'll bring a bomb there, and maybe from the side of the Wahhabis, this danger is also not wrong, right? Guys, well, you have to... No, life is generally a dangerous thing, it's clear, and taxi drivers, and taxi drivers, and sellers, and non-sellers. Listen, organize civil patrols, it's not the organization itself that should be, but the organization specifically, right here, from the side of the authorities. Civil patrol, yes, guys, sign up, please, go. Maybe, maybe.
######## START OF 000110.MP3 (0:50:52 - 0:51:22s) ########
 Maybe you're right in some way, but I'm not offering you a concrete algorithm that you need to act like this, like this, like this, like this. I'm talking about changing your attitude to the present day. You need to understand that our life is a little different today, and therefore, in principle, both this and that, and 20 and 30 are needed.
######## START OF 000111.MP3 (0:51:20 - 0:51:50s) ########
 and then the 20th and 30th. Do you understand what I'm talking about? But we are in complete relaxation, as they say. Absolutely in complete. Nobody wants to do anything and that's it. And we continue to live as if nothing is happening. And this is not so. And a lot of bad things are happening. And then we just discuss, state and discuss. And we are waiting for some big guys to do something. Let's make someone do something.
######## START OF 000112.MP3 (0:51:48 - 0:52:18s) ########
 Let's make someone do something. Don't you see the district police? Drag him by the ear. The district police does not answer the phone. Come to the point of reference. If he is not there, write a statement. Or come to the head of the district police department. In the police department. If the head of the district police department does nothing, go to the prosecutor's office and say, he does nothing. I tell you as a deputy, including, that they are very afraid. In the police department, when they go to the prosecutor's office, and they say that they are not doing anything. And in any case, someone will definitely appear.
######## START OF 000113.MP3 (0:52:16 - 0:52:46s) ########
 In any case, there will definitely be some Chizhkov, and maybe, in two days, another one will appear instead of him, because the previous one will immediately resign. The option may be such, but nevertheless, you need to move, you need to do something yourself. I'm listening to you, you are on air. — Hello. — Hello. — Well, about Chizhkovs, I'll tell you such a case. I have a house, yes, I have separate apartments, they like to rest in the summer, next to the house.
######## START OF 000114.MP3 (0:52:44 - 0:53:14s) ########
 in the summer, next to the house, in nature. At the same time, they are drinking alcohol, drinking beer, vodka, shouting songs until 12 o'clock. So, all last summer, I really called the police, I said, guys, come, make a protocol. They say, we will come, no one comes. In the end, I reached some kind of district police officer, who turned out to be some kind of a substitute for him, roughly speaking. They say, the district police officer is a substitute for him.
######## START OF 000115.MP3 (0:53:12 - 0:53:42s) ########
 I was a deputy, roughly speaking. The district police officer got sick, and they put a guy, a lieutenant, and he said, I'm looking at the registration and you call every week. I say, guys, because they drink and really break public order. I say, what can we do? I say, guys, this is an administrative fine, come, fine twice, no one will be. People don't go. I say, guys, people don't go.
######## START OF 000116.MP3 (0:53:40 - 0:54:10s) ########
 But people don't go. And in connection with the problem of checking, so to speak, the visitors, they will not check it even more. Because one thing is, let's say, to come there to scare the alcoholics. — I understand, yes. But you know... — You'll be stunned. The volume of work is crazy. — So what? What is the volume of work crazy? — Well, then... — So, I understand that the Ministry of Internal Affairs does nothing, right? — Well, that is, nothing at all. I can tell you about certain claims myself.
######## START OF 000117.MP3 (0:54:08 - 0:54:38s) ########
 I can tell you about certain claims for a long time, but wait, listen, don't talk to me in parallel. We will now remember 2 million cases and a whole car of claims, Kucheskov and not Kucheskov. It is clear, and I can tell you for a long time, but we need mobilization, complete mobilization.
######## START OF 000118.MP3 (0:54:36 - 0:55:06s) ########
 We need mobilization, complete mobilization, and society in the first place. And when there is mobilization of society, there will definitely be mobilization of the same district you are talking about. It was already there. It was. It was all the same in much worse times. When the police, then the police, did not have fuel in the cars. When there were no cars themselves. When the bandits rode on Mercedes, not on UAZs or on some Zhiguli, which, in principle, did not have any fuel.
######## START OF 000119.MP3 (0:55:04 - 0:55:34s) ########
 on some Zhiguli, which, in principle, did not start and could not move from the place. It was all. And then we had these Chechen wars. At that time, not good. But I remember how we sealed basements, sealed attics. Was it? It was. Men after work came, went with the police officers, patrolled the territory. Was it? It was. How could we do it? Was it something unusual?
######## START OF 000120.MP3 (0:55:32 - 0:56:02s) ########
 Something unusual? Something magical? No. There was just a mobilization and we realized that if we don't start doing it now, everything will be bad. I say again, what are we waiting for? When I say we, I don't mean just me, Evgeny Vorkunov and all of us, ordinary people. I'm talking about the Ministry of Internal Affairs, too. What are we waiting for? Maybe it's time, or maybe the Russian National Guard, as it's called now, maybe it's time to start doing it?
######## START OF 000121.MP3 (0:56:00 - 0:56:30s) ########
 Maybe it's time to do something? And this way we'll cover them from at least 8 out of 10 directions for terrorist acts. Something has to be done. Let's change the subject. I'm listening to you. All attention.
######## START OF 000122.MP3 (0:56:28 - 0:56:58s) ########
 I'm listening to you with all my attention. Hello. Hello. I fully agree with you about the mobilization of society, but I would like to offer you such a business plan. I would like to offer you such a business plan to decapitate the entire Ukrainian company.
######## START OF 000123.MP3 (0:56:56 - 0:57:26s) ########
 to make a legal document that the head of the state of Ukraine and several people who are in charge of it are terrorists, supporting terrorist acts. They are terrorist criminals. In America, for example, they have a website where they write down the names of the people who are behind the head of the state.
######## START OF 000124.MP3 (0:57:24 - 0:57:54s) ########
 where the reward is announced for the head of certain people, who they designated as criminals. There are people who can pay 5 million dollars for it. If we make the same document.

It turns out that all the necessary help is needed, said the governor of the city, Alexander Beglov. On the air of the Radio of Russia, St. Petersburg, he noted that the victims of the explosion will receive compensation from the government of the city in the amount of 500 thousand rubles or 250 thousand, depending on the severity of the state. The family of the victim, Alexander Beglov, was taken to the hospital.

 The family of the victim will be awarded 1 million rubles. The explosion in a cafe on University Street in St. Petersburg happened the night before the death of a military correspondent, Vladlen Tatarsky. The explosive device was in the statuette that was given to him. The head of the Belgorod region reported about another shelling from the USSR. According to Vyacheslav Gladkov, the village of Pervomaisk was under fire. In his telegram channel, the governor wrote that there were no victims. Gladkov clarified that the explosion was caused by a nuclear bomb.

Today Gladkov reported that in the shelling of the village of Voznesenovka, Shebekinsky district, no one was injured. Russia will suspend the payment of contributions to the OBSC Parliamentary Assembly. The State Duma Council made such a decision, said the Speaker of the House of Representatives Vyacheslav Volodin. In his telegram channel, he wrote that they would not do it.

 He wrote on his channel that there will be no contributions for this year. According to the deputy, the Russian side is facing attempts to prevent the work of its delegation in the OBSC Parliamentary Assembly. Volodin stressed that Moscow should not pay for what it did not participate in. The SBU has publicly accused blogger Yuriy Podolyak.

Veseliy Poselok is with us, Krasnodar is with us, Temirtau, Kazakhstan is with us, Vitebsk is with us, Stuttgart is with us, Zakarpattia region, Neftekansk, plus 15 degrees, it's hot. Well, that's you, of course, yes. It's not hot at all. Mmm... The cities have run away. Well, okay, let's continue.
######## START OF 000138.MP3 (1:03:56 - 1:04:26s) ########
 The cities ran away. Well, okay, let's continue. About the deck of cards. What did they do? And this scheme worked, by the way. They immediately took and distributed everywhere, just in huge quantities, a deck of cards. They already took Baghdad at that time, there everything, but here they distributed a deck of cards. There were photos of all the tops of Iraq. The top leadership of Iraq. Well, Tuzlai is, respectively, Saddam Hussein.
######## START OF 000139.MP3 (1:04:24 - 1:04:54s) ########
 Accordingly, there is Saddam Hussein, Joker and Tuzi, there is Saddam Hussein, Taha Yasin Ramadan, there and so on. Tariq Aziz is the king, there is Najisabri, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, there is also probably the king, there is the Minister of Internal Affairs, there is something else, something else, the chief of the Mukhabarat. And on each deck it was written how much they were ready to pay for this person. And it worked! For a second! How did they find Saddam Hussein? They worked exactly on this. Remember, one scoundrel called us on the air.
######## START OF 000140.MP3 (1:04:52 - 1:05:22s) ########
 Remember, one scoundrel called us on the air, who said that he needs 10 million to arrest Putin? Remember, yes? We, unfortunately, lost his phone, we need to catch him next time, I will determine him by voice, yes. The story worked. From the clan of Saddam Hussein, in the same region where he himself was born, Tikrit and so on, and so on, came, knocked on the Americans, told where he was, those came and took him.
######## START OF 000141.MP3 (1:05:20 - 1:05:50s) ########
 They came and took him. They got the money, everything is fine. I say, why not do it? Taking into account certain nuances of mentality, I think it would work. Turchinov in this list, Zelensky, someone else. Yes, they will drag it, honestly. But let's just announce this story. Why not? But we are above this all the time. And I don't understand why we are above this. I just don't understand. Why do we need to be under this?
######## START OF 000142.MP3 (1:05:48 - 1:06:18s) ########
 Sometimes I say, why should we be like them? Let's show that we are nobler and smarter. We are nobler and smarter anyway. We are nobler and smarter anyway. Today this state is absolute evil. And it is headed by absolute scoundrels. Let's see what people who work as advisors to the head of state say. They say that the metropolitan needs to be promoted and other high-ranking priests need to be removed.
######## START OF 000143.MP3 (1:06:16 - 1:06:46s) ########
 The rest of the high-ranking priests there need to be physically destroyed. Physically destroy! This had to be done earlier. Once on the knees, put, shot, and on this closed the whole issue. Now, of course, it is more difficult to do, but it does not mean that it is impossible to do. For a second! Here with these people we have a case. With these people. This is an absolute evil, not a state. This state is sharpened only for one thing. To bring us maximum damage.
######## START OF 000144.MP3 (1:06:44 - 1:07:14s) ########
 We must do our best to destroy as many of our people as possible, any of them, absolutely, whether in uniform or unarmed. We must understand this, we must answer. But we are not, we are noble, we are higher, we are not inferior. And it seems to me that this is the wrong position. I talked about it and insisted on it. We should not play nobility when we are talking about life and death.
######## START OF 000145.MP3 (1:07:12 - 1:07:42s) ########
 It's called life and death. What nobility are we playing? Why here we can just, well, you can, you can calmly, I don't know, in some bar not to serve a person who came there in uniform or with a symbol of a special military operation. And nothing. In some tire repair shop, in a smelly one, you can not serve military trucks with the symbol of Z, V or O. In a restaurant.
######## START OF 000146.MP3 (1:07:40 - 1:08:10s) ########
 In a restaurant you can refuse people who ask for borsch and enter into a discussion with them and prove that borsch is not a Russian dish, but Ukrainian. Just don't shout the word Ukraine, and the rest is present. But in our country, for some reason, it is possible. In our university, you can turn on a fool and arrange a meeting of some diaspora.
######## START OF 000147.MP3 (1:08:08 - 1:08:38s) ########
 a diaspora with all the attributes, flags, all the things. In our country, we could have libraries with books about the famous Bandera and Shukhevich. We could do that, but we don't look like them. We are above that. No, it won't work. It won't work at all. And all the stories about capitalism and so on, it doesn't work like that. It doesn't work.
######## START OF 000148.MP3 (1:08:36 - 1:09:06s) ########
 It doesn't work like that. By the way, an interesting thing. I've been thinking, we keep asking how we are chasing gas through their territory, paying them money for this transit, what nonsense is this, absurdity, madness, what kind of gestures of goodwill are these, and so on. What I've remembered is that... Where did this come from? Evgeny Vorkunov knows. Do you remember Karl XII?
######## START OF 000149.MP3 (1:09:04 - 1:09:34s) ########
 Do you remember Carl XII? Do you remember him? Do you know him? No, he doesn't. Carl XII. Are you laughing? Well, yes. Once I asked the same question to a student audience and various versions were given. And you're laughing. Carl XII, in the midst of the war with Russia, suddenly writes a letter to Peter I.
######## START OF 000150.MP3 (1:09:32 - 1:10:02s) ########
 He wrote a letter to Peter the First. Just think about it. He wrote a letter to Peter the First and said, Listen, I have neither resources, nor weapons, nor food to continue the fighting. He wrote a letter to Peter the First, with whom he is fighting. Do you know what Peter the First did? What do you think he did? Evgeny, what are your options? What do you think? Yes, you won't believe it, he took and sent the caravans.
######## START OF 000151.MP3 (1:10:00 - 1:10:30s) ########
 He took it and sent it to the camp. He said, I received these resources, food, weapons, ammunition, and I will buy it all. During the fighting, in full swing. I will buy it all. Peter the Great sends it all and does not charge a penny for it. A wonderful story. I realized when it all started. That's when it all started. That's when. Yes, yes. Yes, in general, Carl XII is a curious man.
######## START OF 000152.MP3 (1:10:28 - 1:10:58s) ########
 In general, Carl XII was a curious historical figure, but we'll talk about it later. Ukraine is losing. It's obvious that Ukraine is losing. It was originally doomed to lose. It has no chance. They can jump, jump, scream, scream, do whatever they want, but they have no chance. They know it.
######## START OF 000153.MP3 (1:10:56 - 1:11:26s) ########
 They know it. No 65 billion, no heroic Dutch, Belgian, Polish, and with them, they won't help, especially with Baltic. Americans won't help. No one will help them. They lose. And that's why they are engaged in terrorist acts. That's why. If everything was fine and smooth with them, they wouldn't do what they do. They are engaged in terrorist acts.
######## START OF 000154.MP3 (1:11:24 - 1:11:54s) ########
 They are engaged in terrorist acts because they are losing. And they need to shift their attention from their failures on the front line. On the front. It is necessary to shift, and plus, also to scare. And it is also desirable to actually, and the split, it is said, to bring there, in this very Russian society, which they hate fiercely, and hate absolutely everyone, and even those who seem to love them, they still love them.
######## START OF 000155.MP3 (1:11:52 - 1:12:22s) ########
 It seems that they are loved, but they still hate them. That's why they do it. Let's listen to the synchronization of Prigozhin, which appeared at night at 23.00. This video appeared. Come on. April 2, 23.00 exactly. Behind me is the building of the city administration. This is a Russian flag. It is written to Vladlen Tatarsky.
######## START OF 000156.MP3 (1:12:20 - 1:12:50s) ########
 The Tatars have written a good memory on this flag. We legally took Bakhmut and the commanders of the units that took the administration and the whole central quarter will carry and put these banners. The banner of the ChVK Wagner. These guys took Bakhmut. It is legally ours.
######## START OF 000157.MP3 (1:12:48 - 1:13:18s) ########
 Our enemy is still in the western quarters. April 2, 23.00. Let's go, guys. Yes. And he also said that the Ukrainian forces are in the western part of the city. Ukrainian TV channels write that Syrsky reported to Zelensky that they left the center of the city.
######## START OF 000158.MP3 (1:13:16 - 1:13:46s) ########
 Zelensky about the fact that they left the city center of the city center under the control of Wagner or Wagner as Prigozhin says probably Prigozhin knows how to say we all say Wagner he says Wagner well, well, then under control under our control the city center and they are really in the western part they arranged their positions there in the high-rise buildings, but at the same time, as they write, the Russian art itself means they demolish all these buildings and this is their love
######## START OF 000159.MP3 (1:13:44 - 1:14:14s) ########
 And this is their tactic, which was there from the first day. They went to residential buildings and arranged their firing positions there. And our, remember, at first, when we faced this tactic, we slipped a little, Mariupol, the same, too much time was lost to take, for example, one house, even, specific. Now they write that the Russians have changed tactics, they just add these high-rise buildings together with the residential buildings.
######## START OF 000160.MP3 (1:14:12 - 1:14:42s) ########
 and they are putting these high-rise buildings together with those who are sitting there in these high-rise buildings. And therefore, most likely, the western areas of the city will be ours, of course. What does Zelensky say at this time? Zelensky says that the defeat in Artemovsk threatens Ukraine with a compromise. Ukraine will face pressure to compromise in case of defeat in Artemovsk. The victory of Russia in Bakhmut will become important for Moscow because of the Russian-Ukrainian relations.
######## START OF 000161.MP3 (1:14:40 - 1:15:10s) ########
 If Kiev becomes important for Moscow, Kiev can start to compromise. He warned that Ukrainians will be unhappy. If Ukrainian army loses control over Artemovsk, Ukraine will face international and domestic pressure aimed at compromising with Russia. I think that Mr. Zelensky doesn't understand what will happen next. There will be no compromise.
######## START OF 000162.MP3 (1:15:08 - 1:15:38s) ########
 There will be no compromise. What compromise? What can it look like? What compromise will Moscow make with Kiev after what we are witnessing? We are witnessing many interesting things, including the order of the International Criminal Court to arrest President Putin. What compromise will someone make with him? There will be no compromise.
######## START OF 000163.MP3 (1:15:36 - 1:16:06s) ########
 I can't pass by, I can't be silent. Lukashenko's statement, when he addressed the Parliament and the nation, where he said, literally, I have a quote, I'll quote it now. Lukashenko, stop, yes, he says, stop now, until the escalation has begun. I have a question right away. Until the escalation has begun, what is escalation? Hasn't it begun?
######## START OF 000164.MP3 (1:16:04 - 1:16:34s) ########
 What is escalation? It hasn't started. We've been observing it for a long time. Maybe it means nuclear war? What does it mean? Ok, let's move on. I'll try to stop hostilities, to declare truce without the right to move troops, weapons and machinery. If the West uses this time to deceive again, Russia will have to use all the power of the army, both the poor and the rich.
######## START OF 000165.MP3 (1:16:32 - 1:17:02s) ########
 and enriched uranium. I think that Lukashenko's proposal is absolutely not profitable for us. Why should we stop? Do we have anyone there? Raise your hand, those who doubt that we will be thrown into the next one. They will definitely do it. No need to doubt. They will definitely do it. Why should we stop? If we take Artemovsk now...
######## START OF 000166.MP3 (1:17:00 - 1:17:30s) ########
 We are now going to Artemovsk. I think that the same will be in Sovdeevka. It is still unclear what will happen next. We are going to be on the wheel. They only tell stories about their offensive. I hope that our people, who are in charge of our group, have an operational situation and understand what to do if they go on the offensive. Why should we stop? We should not send this ambassador from Peter I to Charles XII.
######## START OF 000167.MP3 (1:17:28 - 1:17:58s) ########
 We'll send the first Carl XII tomorrow, another one. We'll stop. I didn't like this strange Lukashenko's statement. There can't be any compromise with them. When Zelensky says this, I think he doesn't even believe in it himself. What kind of compromise is this? Is this a compromise based on... How can this compromise look like? When I hear that we can talk to them...
######## START OF 000168.MP3 (1:17:56 - 1:18:26s) ########
 about the fact that we can agree on something with them, come to some compromise, I just broke my head already, how it can look like. That is, we leave half of the territory of the new subjects of the Russian Federation under their control? This is a compromise? We have been conducting hostilities for a year in order to what? In order to keep all these scoundrels sitting and beautiful?
######## START OF 000169.MP3 (1:18:24 - 1:18:54s) ########
 We were still sitting and feeling great. And then we were telling, we were making a fuss about the whole world, and the whole world would make a fuss about it, that Russians, how to find such a word, were shitting themselves and couldn't do anything. This is what compromise is going to be. I like the idea of buying all these freaks and bringing them to court. I like this idea.
######## START OF 000170.MP3 (1:18:52 - 1:19:22s) ########
 I like this idea. And then, you know what I thought about? We already bought Kiev once. Evgeny, you know, right? What year was it? Tell me. Oh, you're all, Evgeny. I don't remember the year, but in my opinion it was the 17th century, if I'm not mistaken. We paid there some thousand rubles to the Poles, yes, we bought Kiev. And you won't believe it, nothing has changed in Ukraine today. Nothing has changed there.
######## START OF 000171.MP3 (1:19:20 - 1:19:50s) ########
 But nothing has changed there. I talked to a person who told about Dnepropetrovsk, they call it Dnepr, he is from there. And he has contacts, he communicates with different comrades there. Not an ordinary person, in general, continues to communicate with different comrades there. You know what these people say? They say that the city is under the control of Korban and Filatov.
######## START OF 000172.MP3 (1:19:48 - 1:20:18s) ########
 They have created their own ChVK, armed, pay salaries, and call it terror defense. They do not obey Kiev, they control Dnepropetrovsk. Kolomoisky was moved away, he is sitting somewhere in Ivano-Frankivsk, and he has no position in Dnipro. And he says, you can easily agree with them, you just need to pay a certain price and take the city. Is it normal? Nothing has changed.
######## START OF 000173.MP3 (1:20:16 - 1:20:46s) ########
 Nothing has changed. Years go by, centuries pass, and they are still talking about the Gishef. We remember all their Mazep and all the others. We just need to give a new price. As an option, why not?
######## START OF 000174.MP3 (1:20:44 - 1:21:14s) ########
 to the state in which it is now, these should be judged. And it seems to me that if you need to pay 10 million dollars for the head of the same Turk, why not do it? Why not do it? We need to make sure that they do not feel safe, so that they understand that, yes, the Russians have also bitten, bitten and no longer slip.
######## START OF 000175.MP3 (1:21:12 - 1:21:42s) ########
 They've already bitten and won't slip. And there can be no compromise. And let's put Turchinov here. And let's put, I don't know, and... And then we'll put them on the list, we know the whole list. All of them here. Why not? A deck of cards. Let's put Bachonki there. Let's draw. Let's draw, draw and write the names. Good story.
######## START OF 000176.MP3 (1:21:40 - 1:22:10s) ########
 I read this text in one of our Telegram channels. Look. We must also kill their assets in Ukraine. Playing good guys with bloody rockets will end up with our best people being killed in our cities. I understand this fair, let's say, indignation,
######## START OF 000177.MP3 (1:22:08 - 1:22:38s) ########
 And then I thought and thought, well, wait, we have a rich experience, we have a rich experience, what happened to Bandera, their hero, where is he? And how did it happen? And what happened to Konovalec? The list is huge, we actually have a rich experience, why don't we do it?
######## START OF 000178.MP3 (1:22:36 - 1:23:06s) ########
 Actually, I'm not doing this. Well, why? Does anyone have an answer? We do not want to be likened again? What do we not want to be likened to? To whom? We are talking about the existence of our state. Go and ask Gurgen, Gurgen will tell you what Israel is doing when it is believed that we are talking about the life of a Jewish person.
######## START OF 000179.MP3 (1:23:04 - 1:23:34s) ########
 about the Jewish state, about the security issues. Gurgen just called and saw the issues. Let's be like them, let's be like those comrades, let's be like those other comrades who are looking for those who threaten their security all over the world, as they say, grab them and drag them to some secret prisons, and do whatever they want with them. They keep them in their prisons, not secret, for decades, not saying a word.
######## START OF 000180.MP3 (1:23:32 - 1:24:02s) ########
 without any charges, let's be like this, but for some reason we don't want to be like anyone else, we are on our own. What does Pinochet have to do with it, Yevgeny? What does Pinochet have to do with it? What does Pinochet have to do with it? Pinochet dealt with his own people, with his own people. They still find brotherly graves in Santiago. Pinochet has nothing to do with it, it's not the same.
######## START OF 000181.MP3 (1:24:00 - 1:24:30s) ########
 Otherwise, it has nothing to do with it. It's not what I'm talking about. After the twins were attacked in New York, the Americans began to conduct a military operation in Afghanistan. Because they thought that Osama Bin Laden was behind it, he was attacking their security, and therefore, in fact, no borders are an obstacle to them, they must destroy it.
######## START OF 000182.MP3 (1:24:28 - 1:24:58s) ########
 They should destroy it. They did it. Let's be like them. Why not? I say, let's be like Israel. Why not? Who should we be like? I was under this post and there was a comment, that we shouldn't be like them. Who should we be like? We should be like them. Everything is going seriously, the games are over. And we are still on some strange wave.
######## START OF 000183.MP3 (1:24:56 - 1:25:26s) ########
 And we are all on some incomprehensible wave, like, incomprehensible, marshmallow, chocolate, milk. We all don't look like anyone. Well, that's it, I won't talk about it anymore, yes. We will talk about other topics, they are also very interesting. Wonderful and perfect.
######## START OF 000184.MP3 (1:25:24 - 1:25:54s) ########
 Great people made various statements about the fact that we are going to transfer our tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus. They made just wonderful statements. I have read these statements several times and still cannot understand what they are talking about. And they are normal people when they say this. And what moves them when they make such stupid statements. We will find out the answer to this question after the news.
######## START OF 000185.MP3 (1:25:52 - 1:26:22s) ########
 after the news release, which will now be on the talk of Moscow. We'll be back in a few minutes. Attention, attention. Moscow is talking. 94.8 Moscow, 19.30, in the studio of Philip Klyamonov. Hello. The media reported that Darya Trepova from St. Petersburg was to be hit.
######## START OF 000186.MP3 (1:26:20 - 1:26:50s) ########
 Darya Trepova was taken from St. Petersburg to Moscow. Suspects in the terrorist attack in a cafe will be taken to the Basman court. RT reported on this. Earlier, the Investigative Committee re-qualified the case of the explosion in a cafe in St. Petersburg for a terrorist attack.

 I've sent a message several times, including to your radio, asking the ravines and the leaders of Jewish communities, who are able to influence the Kiev authorities, to find a compromise with the Orthodox monks. Either our authorities have ordered not to help the monks of Kiev Pechersk Lavra, or everyone is completely indifferent, but the message was never read. A mess everywhere. Here is the content of my message. I would like to address the chief ravine of Kiev and the Kiev region Mikhail Aslan.
######## START OF 000202.MP3 (1:33:48 - 1:34:18s) ########
 Mikhail Asmanov, the head of the Ukrainian Jewish Congress, and the president of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia and the CIS, asked Levayev to show his influence. In Ukraine, in order to find a compromise between the Orthodox monks of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra and the authorities of Ukraine, it is not necessary to evict the monks. Levayev's father said that there is nothing that could not be overcome. The Golden Mayor once said that a person can always do a little more than what was yesterday the limit of his strength.
######## START OF 000203.MP3 (1:34:16 - 1:34:46s) ########
 yesterday seemed to be the limit of his strength. Faith in God is what should unite everyone on this earth and not vice versa. Thank you very much, I really want your participation to be useful for the monks with respect. I read your message, read your message, but nothing will work out. Even if these respected people to whom you are addressing, they will try to do something, nothing will work out, because the office of the president will come.
######## START OF 000204.MP3 (1:34:44 - 1:35:14s) ########
 The office of the president has made this decision. And they will just squeeze this issue. You saw this picture, it's just incredible. Look what happened in Khmelnitsky, look what's going on in Kiev. Look at these scoundrels who are jumping there and shouting their own, this is absolutely stupid, it's not nonsense who doesn't jump, that's Moscow.
######## START OF 000205.MP3 (1:35:12 - 1:35:42s) ########
 Look at these people who openly tell in the microphone that they were paid some money to stand here. They openly talk about it. And young people and not young people. Look at the people who ... Look at the text. So, a man is standing. And another one comes up to him, another one, also in the form of a man. One of them holds the microphone of Channel 5. And this one asks him, like a correspondent who asks.
######## START OF 000206.MP3 (1:35:40 - 1:36:10s) ########
 The correspondent asks, why can't they leave the country? Because all the guys are fighting now, you see, and there's no one to come here and burn this godforsaken place. That's the only reason. He asks, how did you react to the fact that Peter Lebed, the one who is the Metropolitan of Moscow, is now under house arrest with an electronic bracelet?
######## START OF 000207.MP3 (1:36:08 - 1:36:38s) ########
 He was under house arrest with an electronic bracelet. He answers, he should be twisted like a ram, put on his knees in the forest, shoot in the head and release this video to all Russian media. There should be no conversations, no house arrest, no law. And there is a woman passing by, he answers her in reply, shouts, we are not Christians. She says, we are Christians, we are not Christians, we are pagans, and so on.

 Do you understand? Do you think that you can reach an agreement with these people? Of course not! Of course not! They will push the monks out of there, no doubt! No doubt! Metropolitan Pavel, yes, indeed, the court quickly considered the whole thing, put him under house arrest. So it's good, he's lucky, because in this country, which is called Ukraine,
######## START OF 000209.MP3 (1:37:04 - 1:37:34s) ########
 In a country called Ukraine, it is possible to have the option that this scoundrel was talking about. And they were driven there by people who are following Zelensky's direct orders. Do you want Zelensky to listen to the representatives of Jewish communities? No, it won't happen. It won't happen. What can we do? I don't know what we can do. To be honest...
######## START OF 000210.MP3 (1:37:32 - 1:38:02s) ########
 I honestly believe that we can't do anything in this situation Well, that's because Of course, there is a chance again sprinkle your head with ash and start tell that we missed this very moment again Well, yes, it really is that we led Russian Orthodox Church, yes, there was a certain
######## START OF 000211.MP3 (1:38:00 - 1:38:30s) ########
 when she led a certain line, if you can call it politics, which partially led to what we have today. We have on the air, says Moscow, there was a wonderful expert who said very correct things, so it is. He clearly laid out everything on the shelves. This universal patriarch of Bartholomew, who was provided by Thomas by the Orthodox Church of Ukraine,
######## START OF 000212.MP3 (1:38:28 - 1:38:58s) ########
 The Church of Ukraine. This man was not known by anyone, by and large. And he had no universal title. It really is so. And the Russian Orthodox Church began to call him so. And then this title, or title, yes, it's probably still correct. And this title, then, with the help of our church hierarchs, went into public.
######## START OF 000213.MP3 (1:38:56 - 1:39:26s) ########
 of church hierarchs went to society. And now in Bartholomew, when we talk about Bartholomew, we always say that the Patriarch of the Universe is Bartholomew. The Russian Orthodox Church restored the monastery, the Russian monastery on Athos. And at the same time, it allocated money for the restoration of all other monasteries. We were told thank you. No one said thank you to us. And no one will say thank you to us. Can we do something here yet? No, I think we need to take lessons.
######## START OF 000214.MP3 (1:39:24 - 1:39:54s) ########
 No, I think we need to take lessons. Everything we are watching today, from all this we need to take lessons and just do not do as we do. I have another question, and I asked him also in my television broadcast, and now, in fact, this question worries me. And where are the other Orthodox countries? Where have they gone? Where? I want to see where Orthodox Greece, where Orthodox Romania, Bulgaria, where are they?
######## START OF 000215.MP3 (1:39:52 - 1:40:22s) ########
 Where is Bulgaria? Where is Orthodox Georgia? Where is Orthodox Moldavia? Where is Serbia? I want to hear their voices on the international arena. We are talking about Orthodox shrines, including... Wait a second. Where are the voices of these countries? I understand everything. NATO, non-NATO, Russia...
######## START OF 000216.MP3 (1:40:20 - 1:40:50s) ########
 Russia was recorded as an enemy, it's all clear. But in Kosovo, for example, the Kosovo metropolitan residence in Grachanitsa, there was a small enclave not far from Pristina, where the Serbs lived, 7,000 people, I think, I don't remember exactly, but I think so, yes. And there was a metropolitan residence, and everything else is Albanian settlements around.
######## START OF 000217.MP3 (1:40:48 - 1:41:18s) ########
 Albanian settlements around. And you understand that what actually threatened and what could have been done with this very metropolitan and with these monks who served there. And the envoys were also there. And who took them under protection? Greeks. Orthodox Greeks. The same in Kosovo Mitrovica. I saw it with my own eyes. The church, the Orthodox Serbian church, was destroyed.
######## START OF 000218.MP3 (1:41:16 - 1:41:46s) ########
 The Orthodox Serbian temple was on the Albanian territory, the city was divided by bridges, on this side were Serbs, on the other side were Albanians. The church, the cemetery and many other objects were on the Albanian side. The Greeks were surrounded and guarded again. This was the French zone of responsibility. The Greeks were guarded. Even in these conditions, they did it. What is happening here? Nobody even says a word.
######## START OF 000219.MP3 (1:41:44 - 1:42:14s) ########
 Nobody says a word. Not a single patriarch. Not Romanian, not Georgian, not any. It's not about Russia, it's about the Orthodox Church. Everyone is silent. What's going on? Even Pope Romans, and the Catholic, the head of the Catholic Church, and the one who said he was ready to do something, some mediation, he said at least something. And where did the Orthodox patriarchs go? Everyone is silent.
######## START OF 000220.MP3 (1:42:12 - 1:42:42s) ########
 Everyone is silent, no one cares. That's why I say, I'm pessimistic, Lavrov won't be able to defend himself, they will take him away. And if the monks are still alive, that's good. And the fact that the Metropolitan is now simply under house arrest, they killed him by putting him on his knees and didn't shoot him in the back of the head, that's already good. Do you understand what an interesting time we live in?
######## START OF 000221.MP3 (1:42:40 - 1:43:10s) ########
 And the time is really interesting. Now, literally in a break, I'm talking to my colleagues. They say that there has never been a case when the former US president was made an article. For the first time in history. Everything that we don't see today, it's all for the first time. For the first time in history, gas pipelines were blown up. For the first time in history, the US won.
######## START OF 000222.MP3 (1:43:08 - 1:43:38s) ########
 For the first time in history, various countries' assets are frozen. Not only ours. For the first time in history, everything that people have is taken away. They don't care about anything. For the first time in history, journalists are brought under sanctions or arrested, or even threatened with criminal charges. This is all for the first time in history. We have such an interesting time. By the way, Trump has already gained 52% of the population.
######## START OF 000223.MP3 (1:43:36 - 1:44:06s) ########
 52% he scored on Prime Minister's Residence, yes? Inside Republicans. That is, the most popular person in the Republican Party. If they don't put him in jail, then he will definitely be the next president of the United States. We listen to you, Anna. Hello, how are you? Hello. Thank you, Roman Georgievich. Nothing to say. Well, thank God. Roman Georgievich, when they destroyed the Orthodox Church in Poland in the 1920s and 1930s, no one wants to talk to them. Not a single Orthodox Church.
######## START OF 000224.MP3 (1:44:04 - 1:44:34s) ########
 Not a single Orthodox Church said anything. And Pope Francis, he's not just a Catholic, he's a Jesuit, and he's joined the Church. Let him say at least something, as he should. Well, yes. But the worst thing is that if there are really pagans there, they will destroy Lavrov. They don't care. Although, in my opinion, there are not even pagans, there are Satanists. And they don't care about that. But there is another terrible thing.
######## START OF 000225.MP3 (1:44:32 - 1:45:02s) ########
 There is another terrible moment. After all, they are trying to destroy more than a thousand-year history of Orthodoxy on these lands. Our Orthodoxy, canonical Orthodoxy, and what? And everyone looks at it as if it is a duty. People come to the Holy Lavra with guns. Where is this visible? Well, yes, it is. But I know. Thank you, thank you, take care.
######## START OF 000226.MP3 (1:45:00 - 1:45:30s) ########
 Thank you, take care of yourself. I know one thing, that it will be learned, it will be learned, and worse they could not come up with anything themselves. This is not from a big mind. The most inappropriate moment to untie, to split the country in a religious direction, to untie, I admit, almost religiously,
######## START OF 000227.MP3 (1:45:28 - 1:45:58s) ########
 I admit, it's almost a religious war. We don't know how it will continue, what it will lead to. We don't know yet. We can see the steps on the other side and the goals on the other side. And what will happen next? We don't know yet, but we'll find out. But the moment for this is definitely the most inappropriate. This is exactly the problem that, apparently, was not enough at all, you know.
######## START OF 000228.MP3 (1:45:56 - 1:46:26s) ########
 I think that if these bad people who are in charge of this country could look at it one step ahead, they would never do it. But they didn't. They made this decision. Moreover, they are still trying to solve this issue in the worst possible way.
######## START OF 000229.MP3 (1:46:24 - 1:46:54s) ########
 In the worst way possible, they tried to bribe the priests. There was one Judas, who was immediately appointed as the watcher of the laurel. He immediately went to the PCU, received his 30 silver coins and now he is a big boss. The rest did not want to, did not go for it. And that's exactly what they began to say in all interviews.
######## START OF 000230.MP3 (1:46:52 - 1:47:22s) ########
 these 30 silver ones there and so on and so on and he was taken out of himself at all, I'm about Zelensky and so he actually let these chain dogs there, which are like jumping to take money kill and shoot burn and beat with sticks and chains can do nothing else and all this is not on the front line, but in the rear I'm listening to you, say good evening, good evening, hello I'm listening to you, say good evening, hello
######## START OF 000231.MP3 (1:47:20 - 1:47:50s) ########
 Roman Georgievich, in my circle, you know, regarding the situation of the terrorist activity, which we know, you know, I'm being looked at with the same eyes, because I say the same thing every time, in fact, we need some simplified type of military propaganda, special military propaganda, which implies that we need to be as involved as possible, as you absolutely noticed. I didn't have time to call in the first part.
######## START OF 000232.MP3 (1:47:48 - 1:48:18s) ########
 I didn't have time to call in the first part, but I had a case recently. I read it right away. I had a car with Ukrainian license plates in my yard, in a residential complex. I didn't even think about it, I just called, dialed, said, please, check it out. They made a hole. I understand that now it will be strengthened, but as for the absurd regime, the Nazi regime in Kyiv, well, here, probably, just the more ...

 I don't know if I'm thinking about it or not, but the more now there will be the same kind of demolition, as you said, inside the religious branch, and there is a feeling that this cannibalization, where the scoundrels are in one place, and they just demolish, and I think it's all planned out like that. I see it this way. It's a sad sight, but I think we need to take active measures, including with the...
######## START OF 000234.MP3 (1:48:44 - 1:49:14s) ########
 including the media, how to denote it, I don't know how it is, of course, but it's necessary to start the process 100 percent already late, but at least now, but better late than never. Well, somehow, you know, Roman Georgievich, if we have such results today, I'm still silent about the fact that we are a needle in the Moscow region, a person who was there in Moskvich, where he was. And I'm not silent, I'm talking about it. No, I'm just asking you, I'm sorry, I haven't heard you for 40 minutes, maybe, yes. Thank you.

Lariok Mariok, who told you that we are waiting for you with bread and salt? I'm not talking about that.

 They will sell it with pleasure. And then they will explain to their guys, who they pay salary, that everything is fine, we have money, everything will be fine, everything will be fine, we are still here, everything is great. Not with bread and salt. I'm not talking about this, I'm talking about something else. I believe in it, in fact. Sergey Alekseevich, hello. Hello, Roman. Hello.
